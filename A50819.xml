         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </p>
            <p>This is that Noble Science, which gives an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the World wherein we live, of its ſeveral Countrys, Mountains, Capes, Seas, Lakes, Rivers, Towns and Citys, Provinces, States, and Kingdoms. A Science without which one cannot he a good Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, or a compleat Stateſman, and which is no ſmall Ornament to any thing of a Gentleman. Therefore it is ſo Taking beyond Sea, but in <hi>France</hi> eſpecially, that there are few Men of any Note or Fortune but are brought up to it. And we find by Experience, that, of all Study's Young Gentlemen are put upon, None is ſo Acceptable and Welcome to 'em, and indeed None ſo fit for Them, as the Study of Geography. For, as it is not only Genteel and Uſeful, but alſo very De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful; ſo a ſhort Time, with a little Application and Help, will ſerve to conquer it. Which makes me Confident, 'twill be well Reliſh'd Here, eſpecially if it be Seaſoned with appoſite Hiſtory.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The Author lives at his Houſe, next to the Nags head, in James-ſtreet, Covent Garden.</hi> Where he is now preparing for the Preſs a large Engliſh Dictionary of Geography, both Ancient and Modern, Inriched with Hiſtory. A Work that will be of great Uſe to all Gentlemen, Scholars, Merchants, Travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers, and generally all Lovers either of Geography or Hiſtory.</p>

                  <p>What think you, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> of the Way uſed now adays to bring up Youth? <hi>Sophronius.</hi> 'Tis doubtleſs an odd kind of way; and, if Men be out in any Thing, 'tis in this. For 'tis undeniably true, that Children are brought up like Slaves till they come to the age of fourteen or fifteen years, or there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abouts. And what for? to make them learn, againſt the grain, perhaps a mouth-full
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:62816:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>of Latin. For of a hundred Scholars that ſpend the prime of their Age in this Torture, I dare affirm there is not the tenth part that after ſeven years Apprenticeſhip can juſtly boaſt to have conquered that Language.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true enough, and I found it ſo by my own experience. They peſter Youth with a pack of hard Words and Rules that confound their Memory, and ſtun their little Intellectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, and all this under the Standart of the Rod. For my part, I am quite beſotted with it, and with much ado ſhall I come to my ſelf again.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus they make of a fine Language, the Terrour and the Plague of Youth; Who, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing incapable of apprehending the beauty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, look upon it as a meer Scare-crow. The Reaſon is, becauſe they are put upon it before their Memory be ſtrong enough to retain ſo many ſtrange words, and their Judgement ripe enough to apprehend the abſtruſe meaning of the Rules. For it is not with the Latin Tongue as with Vulgar Languages, which are learnt with much leſs difficulty, becauſe uſually ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; Whereas the Latin Tongue (as it is uſed now adays in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially) is in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner but a Language for Books.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>What courſe then, my dear <hi>Sophronius,</hi> would you have one to takes?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>This in my judgment would be the moſt proper way. After that a young Lad has learnt to Read and Write, and that he is pretty well inſtructed in the fundamental
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:62816:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>points of the Religion wherein he was born, I would have him put upon ſome eaſie, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, and uſeful Science, until his Judgment were ripe for the Latin Tongue.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>What is that you would have him learn?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>The State and Hiſtory of the World, and particularly of his own native Country. A thing ſo eaſie to learn, that it is not at all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with his tender Years. So pleaſant, and ſo full of charming Variety, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but be taken with it. And withall ſo uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, that he would lay this up as a Treaſure to be uſed in his riper Years. Thus I would have him to apply himſelf to two Things, Geography and Hiſtory. Geography, that would ſhew him the Extent of the habitable World, it's Continents, Iſlands, States, and Provinces, Towns and Cities, its famous Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, Seas, Lakes, Rivers, and other Curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. By Hiſtory he ſhould ſee the different manner of living amongſt Men, their ſeveral Languages, Religions, and Governments, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the various Changes and Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of States.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Oh! had I but taken this courſe. I ſhould not have been laugh'd at, as I was not long ſince in a Company, for confounding (by meer Ignorance) <hi>Swethland,</hi> with <hi>Switzerland.</hi> I ſhould not be puzzled, as I am, reading, the Gazette, to know whether ſuch a Place lies <hi>North</hi> or <hi>South,</hi> and whither it is in <hi>Spain</hi> or <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> This is not all. I am ſo little acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:62816:5"/>with the publick Concerns of the World, that I am quickly mumped, when there ariſes any Diſcourſe of that kind in Company.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus it is to be ill brought up in his Youth. For my part, I cannot conceive how any man that pretends to good Education, can be ſo narrow-Soul'd as to live in this World as if it were all ſhut up in his Neighbour-hood; nor how he can be ſatisfied, if he read either Hiſtory or Forreign News, without ſome Knowledge of thoſe Places which happen to be there mentioned.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>The Truth is, without it one is but half an Hiſtorian; and to live in the World without a competent knowledge of the ſame, is properly to ſee no further than his Noſe, and not to know whereabouts one is. This is, I confeſs, my Caſe; and truly I bluſh at it. But, if ever I have a Son to bring up, I am reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved it ſhall not be ſo with him</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus where a Young Man has made a conſiderable Progreſs both in Geography and Hiſtory (wherein young people take delight) I would have him diſpoſed of for the <hi>Latin</hi> Tongue, eſpecially if his Fancy ſhould lead him to it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But can no Expedient be found out to learn it in leſs time, and with leſs trouble, than now they do in Schools?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you doubt it? I'll tell you of one which I think is very likely. Inſtead of ſo many Latin Schools which ſwarm every
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62816:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>where, and where ſo much precious Time is loſt by reaſon of their tedious and lingring Methods, (beneficial indeed to School-Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters) there ſhould be in every Province ſome Colleges erected, where nothing but Latin ſhould be commonly ſpoken. For, when all is done, the quickeſt and beſt way to learn a Language is not ſo much by the eye as by the ear. And what makes us conquer vulgar Languages ſo much ſooner than the Latin Tongue, but that thoſe are ſpoken, and this is not, in <hi>England</hi> eſpecially?</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>'Tis true. But to what purpoſe ſhall one learn to ſpeak a Language ſo little in uſe here, except to underſtand Books?</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs the ſpeaking Part is ſo much out of date here, even amongſt the greateſt Scholars in the Land, that Strangers are in a maze to ſee Men of ſuch a profound Learning as we have here in <hi>England,</hi> ſpeak <hi>Latin</hi> with ſo much heſitancy. Latin that ſhould be by right the general and ſtanding Language for Scholars of any Nation to converſe in toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But 'tis no wonder, if we conſider how this Language is taught in Latin-Schools, where the very Maſters ſpeak as little Latin, and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves as much in <hi>Engliſh</hi> as they can. Whereas, if they did uſe their Scholars as well to the Speaking as the Reading Part, it would not only forward their Learning, but alſo make them fit to converſe in that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And, though the ſpeaking Latin is not
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:62816:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>altogether; ſo much abroad ſince the French Tongue came up, as it has been formerly; yet it may fall out that a Traveller ſhall ſtand in need of <hi>Latin,</hi> where <hi>French</hi> is not ſo much in requeſt.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>In ſhort, I perceive you would have one learn Latin, by uſing himſelf to ſpeak it; becauſe you conceive it is the readieſt Way.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Right. And to that purpoſe the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Colleges ſhould be provided of able and skilful Maſters, ſuch as ſhould have abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the command of die Latin Tongue.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But you will grant, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that the greateſt benefit of that Language doth lye in the Reading Part.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Now the Queſtion is, whether ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing but Latin in the Schools would advance the Reading Part ſo conſiderably as you imagine. For you know the ſtyle of moſt Latin Writers is very different from any thing of a ſpeaking ſtyle.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis true. But ſtill the ſpeaking part, I hope, would be no hindrance. And, when all is done, the Speaker has this advantage, that he practices his Language two ways, that is by Reading and Speaking; but the Reader, only by Reading.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>There you are in the right. Now let us ſee how you would order your Colleges.</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>

                  <p>But then poor Parents ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the Advantage of bringing up their Children to Scholar ſhip.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>So much the better. For many of them undo themſelves utterly that way; and, when all comes to all, their Children are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten forced to leave off, for want of Help. And then what ſignifies their long ſtrugling, toiling, and moiling after a thing they could not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, but only to make their Lives the more uncomfortable ? Whereas, had they learnt a good Trade, they might live comfortably, and perhaps get enough beſides to give their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren a good Education. And ſo they ſhould not have occaſion to repine at their loſs of Time and Money, and to be juſtly grieved for ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving took ſo much pains about a thing which now is to be forgotten.</p>
                  <p>Learning is Chargeable, and the Harveſt does not always anſwer to the Seeding. 'Tis I confeſs, a great Ornament and Advantage to Perſons of Honour and Eſtates, who are beſt able to make a good Uſe of it, and to keep up its Reputation. But amongſt Men whoſe whole Dependance is Learning, and who are fain to drive a Trade of it, it loſes its Credit, and grows a very Drug. I appeal to theſe Times, now we ſee whole Sholes of poor diſtreſſed Scholars treading upon one anothers heels, and who going along may well uſe <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> his ſaying, <hi>Omnia mecum porto,</hi> I carry with me all I have. What makes them ſo

                  <p>Put the caſe then, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that your Propoſals were approved of by the Publick, how would you order your Scholars For thoſe that come in muſt ſpeak ſome Language or other.

                  <p>To anſwer your Objection, I confeſs that, to compaſs our Deſign, it were conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient that ſuch as ſhould be firſt admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a College ſhould have already ſome ſmat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering of the, Latin Tongue. Which the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters might eaſily and in a ſhort time im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove to ſome degree of Perfection, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſing with them in Latin, and uſing them to ſpeak nothing elſe. And, after the firſt Comers, none ſhould be admitted in, that did not underſtand ſome Latin Words, ſuch as may be got by a good Vocabulary; and ſome familiar Dialogues, like thoſe of <hi>Corderius.</hi> Thus their Tongues being untied by theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Helps, one word would help out ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and converſing with none but ſuch as ſpeak Latin, Neceſſity would breed Attention, as Attention doth Learning. And ſo I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident, that in a years time they would be as forward as thoſe that have lingered four or five years at School.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>By all means. For, though by Rote one may learn a Language with eaſe, yet a Grammar is of great uſe to to confirm that Learning. By that one learns it eaſily, and by this exactly.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>You put me in mind, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> of a Young man that I was told of 'tother day; who had been ſeveral years in <hi>France,</hi> where he had learnt the <hi>French</hi> Tongue in its Purity, but only by Rote. He came back to <hi>England,</hi> where he was very much admired for his <hi>French.</hi> But he had not been here above three Months, when he began to confound the Tenſes of Verbs, the Gender of Nouns, and to make ſtrange Angliciſms.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>All this happen'd for want of Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar-help. And therefore there ſhould be for our Colleges a compendious Grammar, ſuch as might be run over in a ſhort time. Bur, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the main difficulty of the Latin Tongue in the Reading of Authors doth conſiſt in the Conſtruction, the Learners ſhould be uſed frequently to that, is alſo to make Paraphra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. By this means I am confident that a Boy ſhould know Latin enough at a years end to learn the Greek Tongue, and that in three years at fartheſt he might be fitted for the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſity.</p>

                  <p>That indeed were a fine Buſineſs. But there ſhould be very ſtrict Orders kept in thoſe Colleges, and the Collegers ſhould have but little Correſpondence with the reſt of the World.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Very right. And truly there's no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo miſchievous and fatal to young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen as the want of that Coercion for ſome time. For, whilſt they are allowed to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in publick with a Splendor ſutable to their Birth, they meet with that Reſpect and thoſe Careſſes from their Inferiours that fills their minds preſently with Pride and Vanity. Their eyes are ever admiring of fine Garbs, their Ears bewitched with the charming noiſe of the great Eſtates and Honours they are Heirs to, their Fancy's tickled with the flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering expreſſions of Servants and others that are apt to adore a riſing Sun. Thus my young Gentleman hardly feels himſelf for joy, and his ſoft heart ſwells daily like Puff-paſt. Till at laſt he grows too ſtiff to be curbed; and, inſtead of a pliant Willow, he proves a ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born Oak. He becomes <hi>Impatiens Jugi;</hi> and, though perhaps he never learn'd to Obey, yet he thinks it long till he Rules. His Luſt is the only thing he is reſolved to inſlave himſelf to, he runs wherever that hurries him, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thinks it far enough. But one ſtep into Learning puts his Body and Soul out of Joint Learning, pedantick Learning, why ſhould he trouble himſelf with it? He is Learned enough
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62816:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>that is Rich, and that knows how to improve ſenſual and bruitiſh Pleaſures. And ſo there's my <hi>Midas,</hi> with his Aſſes Ears.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>You have hit the Nail on the head. And without doubt it were the beſt way to keep ſuch young men in the dark as much as poſſible, till they have diſcretion and learning enough to appear in publick, and ſo take ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of ſuch Companies as be fitteſt for them to improve themſelves by. But ſtill it will be objected, that a young Man in this Condition will go near to forget his Mother-Tongue; and that, being kept from People of good faſhion, he will grow thereby ſo baſhful that he will hardly dare to peep into the World.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>No ſuch thing. For firſt, as to his forgetting of his Mother-Tongue, he will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo forget it but that he will quickly be able to recover it. But however, to prevent chat In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniency, I would allow my young Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen the receiving of Viſits from their Friends and Relations in the Holy-days. And beſides, there might be an Academy ſet up for every College, to learn in Engliſh at ſet hours, theſe Exerciſes ſo fit for a Gentleman; <hi>viz.</hi> Fencing, Riding the great Horſe, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, &amp;c. Now, to anſwer the other part of your Objection, a ſhort time will make a baſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Young Man forward enough to appear in Company. If one has but wherewithal to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in a good Garb, there is in Man an infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible principle of Vanity that will help to put him forward.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:62816:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                  <p>In fine, I would have the Maſters of every College to be themſelves well bred and polite, of a ſweet and genteel Converſation, and as little pedantick as might be.

                  <p>Pray tell me then, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> in the firſt place, whether you think the World had a beginning or no, or that (according to ſome Philoſophers) it is from all Eternity.</p>

                  <p>I believe rather, according to the Holy Writ, that it was Created (or made of nothing) ſome thouſand years ago by that Supreme and Spiritual Being we Worſhip, an Immortal, Immutable, Incomprehenſible, All-Wiſe, and All-mighty God.</p>

Next to this Orb is the <hi>Chryſtalline</hi> Heaven, thought by ſome to be that which appears ſo pure blew unto our ſight.

                  <p>A Numberleſs Number of Stars, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the eighth Orb; and called fixed Stars, not that they be immovable, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their natural Motion is but flow, and that they keep always the ſame diſtance. Which the Planets do not.</p>
                  <p>But there is beſides a viſible Difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the fixed Stars and the Planets. For it is proper for the fixed Stars to ſparkle, or ſhine with a trembling light, but chiefly in a Serene weather. Whereas the Planets, as the Moon among others, ſend forth ſteady beams, and void of all vibration. Except <hi>Mars, Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> which are obſerved ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to ſparkle; but neither ſo much, nor ſo conſtantly, as the fixed Stars.</p>
                  <p>But how long do you think, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> that the fixed Stars are finiſhing their natural Courſe?</p>

                  <p>According to <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> the Won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of our Age in point of Aſtronomy, they are no leſs than 25412. years before they come to their firſt ſtation.

Then you and I, after that vaſt diſtance of time, ſhall meet here, and hold the ſame Diſcourſes we do now. A pretty Conceit indeed!

                  <p>They reckoned 1022. of them in the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Hemiſphere, the leaſt of which is eighteen times bigger than the Earth.

                  <p>Now you muſt know, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> that the Aſtronomers divide the biggeſt and brighteſt of the fixed Stars into ſix ſeveral Degrees of Magnitude.

                  <p>They are called Planets, that is, wandring Stars, not that they be ſubject to any uncertain or irregular Motion; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have, either in reſpect to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or the fixed Stars, a different Motion, and that they are not always at an equal di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance from each other.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Copernicans</hi> deny the Sun to be a

                  <p>Shall I now tell you the ſeveral (but prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous) Diſtances of the Planets from us? You will be amazed at it.

                  <p>But how comes it, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that whilſt the Sun appears above our <hi>Horizon,</hi> none of the other Planets, and indeed no Star, is ſeen?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>The Reaſon is plain. For a greater Light drowns a leſſer; and the Sun, being as it were the ſource of Light, muſt needs have a greater proportion of it than any of the Stars.</p>

                  <p>Are you then of Opinion, that the Stars have no Light of their own?</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not ſay ſo. But it is credibly thought, they borrow the greateſt part of their Light from the Sun. And therefore it ſeems that God has placed the Sun in the midſt of the Planets, that thoſe above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath it might equally partake of its Splendor.</p>
               </sp>

                  <p>So much for that, <hi>Sophronius;</hi> I deſire now to underſtand their Motion.</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>To clear this Point, you muſt know that thoſe Philoſophers who hold the Sun moves about the Earth (which is the vulgar
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62816:15"/>Opinion) ſuppoſe two ſeveral Motions of the Stars in general. The one Natural or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt;</hi> and the other Violent from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>Weſt.</hi> And they attribute the Cauſe of this laſt Motion, as I have already hinted, to the great Orb called <hi>Primum Mobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le,</hi> which turns from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> round the World with an equal rapidity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the ſpace of twenty four hours, and with it hurries away all the leſſer Orbs. Which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the Sun particularly.</p>
                  <p>Whereas, according to the Natural Motion of the Stars from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> 'tis to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved amongſt the Planets, That cold <hi>Saturn</hi> does not finiſh its Courſe but within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of almoſt thirty years; bright <hi>Jupiter</hi> fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhes his in about twelve years; fiery <hi>Mars,</hi> within little leſs than two years; the <hi>Sun</hi> in one year; fair <hi>Venus,</hi> in one year and a half; <hi>Mercury,</hi> in ſomething leſs than half a year; the <hi>Moon,</hi> in twenty ſeven days and about eight hours.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I do not underſtand theſe contrary Motions. It is apparent, as you ſay, that the Sun moves daily from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> and ſo goes round about the World. But how can it at the ſame time move by a proper motion of its own a quite contrary way, that is, from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt?</hi> How can any thing go back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward and forward at the ſame time? This is paſt my Underſtanding.</p>

                  <p>Then turn the Globe never ſo much about from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> ſtill you will find that the Fly in the mean time gets forward in her courſe from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>East.</hi> And, if you do ſo turn the Globe about, that, as often as it turns quite round, the fly may advance one Degree in her Courſe <hi>Weſtward;</hi> you will find that by turning the Globe three hundred ſixty five times, the fly ſhall be gone as many Degrees in a quite contrary way. Such is the Yearly Courſe of the Sun from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> according to which it goes about one Degree every day, and in a years time runs over the twelve Signs or Conſtellations called the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the Sun.</p>

                  <speaker>Soph.</speaker>
                  <p>The Old Style, which the <hi>Greek</hi> Church and moſt Proteſtants keep ſtill, is the old <hi>Julian</hi> Account, which for many Ages ſeemed to have no ſenſible Error. But in proceſs of time it was diſcovered to be not altogether agreeable with the natural Motion of the Sun, the <hi>Julian</hi> Year exceeding the rue Solar Year ten Minutes, and forty eight Seconds; which cauſed the Equinoxes;and Solſtices yearly to change their Places, and fly back ſo many minutes and ſeconds. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon Pope; Gregory the XIII, by the advice and direction of <hi>Antonius Lilius</hi> and other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Mathematicians, corrected the Calen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, making the Year to conſiſt of three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſixty five days five hours, forty nine mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, twelve ſeconds. And, to the end that the vernal Equinox (which then was on to the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>March</hi>) might be reduced to, the one and twentieth of <hi>March,</hi> as it was at the time of the firſt <hi>Nicene</hi> Council; he commanded ten day in <hi>October</hi> to be left out, ſo as the
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62816:17" rendition="simple:additions"/>fourth day of <hi>October</hi> was accounted for the fourteenth day. This hapned in the Year fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred eighty two, from which time this Account was called the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Account; and ſo came the Diſtinction of Old and New Style, the Old according to the <hi>Julian,</hi> and the New according. to the <hi>Gregorian</hi> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count</p>

                  <p>You know;that in moſt Parts of <hi>Europe</hi> they begin the Year, as the <hi>Romans</hi> did, on the firſt of <hi>January.</hi> And ſo we do here in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> in ſome reſpect, therefore we call it <hi>New-Years-Day</hi> But upon a Civil Account, and for our Date, of Buying or.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now the <hi>Venetians</hi> begin theirs the firſt of

                     <hi>March.</hi> And ſo did <hi>Romulus</hi> the Founder of <hi>Rome;</hi> for 'tis obſerved that before <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> the Month of <hi>July</hi> was called <hi>Quintilis,</hi> or the fifth Month from <hi>March.</hi> The <hi>Moſcovites,</hi> who follow the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, begin their Year the firſt of <hi>Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,</hi> upon this ground For they believe the World began in <hi>Autumn;</hi> and, whereas we reckon our Years from the Coming of Chriſt into the World, they reckon theirs from the time of the Creation.</p>
                  <p>As for Days, you muſt know there is a Natural and Artificial Day; that containing Day and Night, and conſiſting of twenty four hours; this beginning at Sun-riſing, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Sun-ſet. The Natural Day is reckoned in moſt parts of Europe from one midnight to another, reckoning twice twelve hours; that is from Midnight to Noon twelve hours, and from Noon to the Midnight following twelve hours more, beginning with one, two, three, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But in <hi>Italy</hi> (as formerly in <hi>Athens</hi>) they reckon twenty four, hours all along without coming back to one, as we do; and that from Sun-ſet to Sun-ſet. At <hi>Nuremberg,</hi> and ſome other Places of <hi>Germany,</hi> they reckon their Days (as the Ancient <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chaldeans</hi>) from one Sun-riſing to another; beginning with one a Clock, and ſo on to the twenty fourth hour. 'Tis true the <hi>Jews</hi> had (beſides their Civil Day) a Sacred Day, deſtined for Holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, which began at Sun-ſet, and continued till
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62816:18" rendition="simple:additions"/>the next Sun-ſet. In <hi>Moſcovy</hi> they reckon their day from the Sun-riſing till Sun-ſet; and, when the Sun is gone down, then they reckon the firſt hour of the night, and ſo on, till the Sun appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again over their <hi>Horizon</hi> finiſhes the time of their Night and begins with them a new Day.</p>

For, as without the Light of the Sun the whole Frame of Nature ſhould be buried in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; ſo, without the Heat that ariſes from it, no living Creature could live.

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis a privation of its beams in ſome part of the Earth, cauſed by the Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the Moon betwixt the Sun and that part of the Earth. Which happens when the Moon being in the ſame Sign and Degree the Sun is in, it falls out that theſe three Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy's, the Sun, the Moon, and the Earth are <hi>diametrally</hi> oppoſite.</p>

                  <p>This you ſhall know, when I have firſt made a ſhort Deſcription of it. The Moon, (as I have already obſerved to you) is the loweſt of all the Planets, and conſequently that which is neareſt to us. Therefore her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence muſt needs be the ſtronger over all <hi>Sublunary</hi> Things.</p>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:62816:19"/>
                  <p>'Tis a Planet much ſubject to Change, and ſeen in divers Shapes; that ſometimes ſhines, and ſometimes does not. And, when it does, it is more or leſs, according to the proportion of Light it receives from the Sun. We call it new Moon, when it is in conjunction with the Sun; and then it gives us no light, becauſe the dark part of it is to us ward. But four days after it makes its firſt appearance in the ſhape of two bright horns, the reſt of her Body being dark; and then is the firſt Quarter. Being a Week old, half of it appears bright, and the other half dark; and then it is called a <hi>Creſcent,</hi> or half-Moon. Thus it increaſes for a week more, till it comes to. be full; and then, being diametrally oppoſite to the Sun, this ſtrikes its Beams upon that the more fully. Four days after full Moon, it begins to Decreaſe and loſe its light (which is called the Wane of the Moon;) and three days after this it appears again in the form of a <hi>Creſcent.</hi> So, it loſes its Light gradually, till it is New-Moon again.</p>

                  <p>But, as the Sun, ſo the Moon is ſubject to Eclipſes Now an Eclipſe of the Moon is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe but its privation of the Light of the Sun, occaſioned by the Interpoſition of the Earth betwixt the Sun and Moon. Which does not commonly happen but upon the full of the Moon, when this Planet is <hi>diametrally</hi> oppoſite to the Sun.</p>
                  <p>Thus much for the Sun and Moon, whoſe Influences (of all the Planets) are moſt ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken notice of.</p>

                  <p>Ay Marry, Now you Started a pret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Queſtion indeed; but it is not for me to ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy you whether or no there be ſuch a Thing in Nature. <hi>Lucian,</hi> a man of eminent parts, (but as baſe an Apoſtate from the Chriſtian Faith in which he was bred) was the firſt that writ of this new World in the Moon; but then he propoſed it as a meer Fancy of his own, and ſo he affords us in one of his Dialogues a conceited Character of it. But of late times,
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:62816:20" rendition="simple:additions"/>that Fancy of his is become a Matter of more ſerious debate. Inſomuch that ſome have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured with great pains to make it probable, that there is another World in the Moon, In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited (as This is) by People of divers Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages, Cuſtoms, Policy's, and Religions. And, more than ſo, ſome Means and Ways have been propoſed to Conſideration for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an Intercourſe and Commerce betwixt That and This. The like Indeavours there are to prove that the Earth is a Planet. And, long before <hi>Lucians</hi> time, <hi>Ariſtophanes</hi> (a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Man amongſt the old <hi>Greek</hi> Poets) ſpeaks in one of his Comedy's of a City of <hi>Cuckoos</hi> in the Clouds, which he calls <hi>Nephelo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coccygia.</hi>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>To make then no further Preamble, you muſt know the Air is a thin, tranſparent, luke-warm, and moiſt Element, that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds the Globe of the Earth. 'Tis the Air that penetrates the ſubſtance of mixt Body's, and which makes way for Generation. 'Tis the Air that ſerves for our Reſpiration, for Vocal and Inſtrumental Muſick, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Birds of the Air move with great Swift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. In fine, 'tis the Scene where Nature acts thoſe Wonders we call Meteors.</p>
                  <p>The ſame is by Piloſophers divided into three Regions, <hi>viz.</hi> the Upper, Middle, and Lower Region.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Theſe are, I ſuppoſe, the three Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices you intend to treat me with; a very Airy Diet.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>You found it out. But to be ſerious, the Upper Region begins from the Sphere of the Moon, and reaches to that part of the Air where the Vapours condenſate. The Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle Region, which follows next, is bounded by the reflected Beams of the Sun. And the Lower reaches from thence to the Surface of the Earth. But, becauſe the Sun-Beams reach higher in Summer-time than they do in Winter, therefore 'tis to be concluded, that in Summer the Middle Region is leſſer, and the Lower greater, than in Winter.</p>
                  <p>Now 'tis the General Opinion of Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers, that the Supream (or Upper) Region is accidentally warm, either by reaſon of the fiery
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:62816:21" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Sulphureous Exhalations which aſcend thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or becauſe of the violent Motion of the Spheres from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> or laſtly (accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>Ariſtotle</hi>) becauſe it is next to the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lementary Fire which he places in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cave of the Moon. The Middle Region is cold. And the Lower is ſometimes warm and ſometimes cold, according as the Sun affects it with its Beams by its nearneſs or remoteneſs.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But what is that we call Wind?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis nothing elſe but an Agitation, or a ſtrong Motion of the Air; occaſioned chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the Sun, and by Vapours and Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. For the Sun by its natural brightneſs does rarifie the Air, and this being rarify'd requires more room, and ſo ſtruggles hard for't. On the other ſide, the Exhalations from the Earth and Vapours from the Water being raiſed in great quantity and with ſome Violence up to the middle Region of the Air, do often occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion a Wind by their Conflict with the cold Air they meet in that Region. But there are other Cauſes aſſigned for the Wind. As the Clouds, when they rarifie, or when by their deſcent, they preſs the Air. To which add the Snow and Ice, (eſpecially in Mountainous places) that often turn into Wind. Which is the Reaſon why the Streight of <hi>Magellan,</hi> having on both ſides of it high Mountains always covered with Snow, is ſubject to thoſe Counter-Winds, which beat with equal Fury on all parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; Inſomuch that, which way ſoever a man
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62816:22" rendition="simple:additions"/>Steer his Courſe, he ſhall be ſure to have the Wind againſt him.</p>
                  <p>Now the Winds move croſs ways, that is, neither upwards nor downwards. The Reaſon is, becauſe when the Air is preſſed down ſtill there ariſe more Vapours which beat it back.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But how many ſorts of Winds do you reckon?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>A great many. And they are chiefly divided into Cardinal, and Collateral. We call Cardinal Winds thoſe that blow exactly from the four Quarters of the World, <hi>North, South, Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Weſt;</hi> from whence we call them generally <hi>North, South, Eaſt,</hi> and <hi>Weſt</hi> Winds.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But how ſhall I know the one from the other?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>If you do but know the <hi>North,</hi> you know all. For it is but turning your face ſtreight to the <hi>North,</hi> and then you have the <hi>Eaſt</hi> on your right hand, the <hi>Weſt</hi> on the left, and the <hi>South</hi> juſt behind you oppoſite to the <hi>North.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then by the <hi>Eaſt</hi> you muſt underſtand the <hi>Eaſt</hi> Equinoctial, that is where the Sun riſes in an Equinox; and accordingly by the <hi>Weſt</hi> you muſt underſtand the <hi>Weſt</hi> Equinoctial, where the Sun Sets in an Equinox.</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>You muſt know there are no leſs than 28. of theſe, that is, ſeven betwixt two Cardinal ones; as betwixt <hi>North</hi> and <hi>Eaſt, Eaſt</hi> and <hi>South, South</hi> and <hi>Weſt, Weſt</hi> and <hi>North.</hi> Amongſt which, thoſe that are juſt in the middle betwixt two Cardinal Winds are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the chiefeſt. So, reckoning the four Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal Winds, there are in all 32. Winds, the Names of which you have in their Order in the following Scheme.</p>
                  <stage>See the Figure of the Winds.</stage>
                  <p>And now, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I muſt obſerve to you, 1. That in <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Autumn</hi> Winds are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly more brief and more violent than ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a hot <hi>Summer</hi> or a froſty <hi>Winter.</hi> 2. That Winds are more frequent from the <hi>Eaſt</hi> then from the <hi>West,</hi> eſpecially in the <hi>Torrid</hi> Zone. In <hi>England</hi> the <hi>East</hi>-Wind is moſt common in
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:62816:24"/>the <hi>Spring,</hi> and is counted an unwholſom Wind, both to Plants and Living Creatures, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Proverb that ſays, <hi>Wind from the East is neither good for Man nor Beast.</hi> But in <hi>Summer</hi>-time the <hi>South-Weſt</hi> Wind does moſt times predominate. 3. That <hi>East</hi> and <hi>North</hi> Winds are commonly both colder and ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than either <hi>West</hi> or <hi>South</hi> Winds, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in our Zone. 4. That Winds are conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for two things principally, that is for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, and (except the <hi>East</hi> Wind) to pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie the Air.</p>

                  <p>There are thoſe who pretend to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee what Wind will blow. What do you think of it, <hi>Sophronius?</hi>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs one may give ſometimes a ſhrewd gueſs, &amp; the Mariners (thoſe <hi>Amphibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Creatures that live moſt upon Wind and Water) have a pecular Gift that way. The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients gueſſed at it by the ſight of ſome Birds, of a <hi>Dolphin,</hi> or of ſome Meteor or other. Now our Sea-men, when they ſee a ſmall Cloud of a pale or blackiſh colour, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude a Wind from thence. So when the Sun does not riſe clear, but ſeems to be ſpotted, or when it is overcaſt with a pale or a black Cloud, it preſages either Wind or Rain. The ſames is obſerved of the Sun, if it look pale when it ſets. And then, if clouded with black Clouds, 'tis a ſign of a <hi>North</hi> Wind. The Moon, when it looks red, is lookt upon as a certain ſign of windy weather, according to the Verſe,</p>

                  <p>A Tempeſtuous Guſt of Wind, ſuch as deſtroys moſt Ships at Sea that are in its way, pulls down Houſes, and pulls up Trees by the root.

Firſt, the Sun exhales a great quantity of Water from the Sea into a Cloud, and then it guſhes down with great violence; followed with a terrible Tempeſt of Wind, which laſts about two or three hours, and ſometimes longer.

                     <hi>Stella Diſcurrens,</hi> a ſhooting Star, is a fiery Meteor of the Middle Region, of a Globous Figure, which conceiving Fire by the coldneſs of the Air runs with an oblique motion. Whereas <hi>Stella Cadens,</hi> or a falling Star, comes down, and ſo appears like a Star falling from the Sky. <hi>Lancea Ardens,</hi> a fiery Lance, is a long and well compacted Meteor, which having took fire falls down like a fire-brand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Draco Volans,</hi> or a flying Dragon, is a cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer ſort of Meteor ſeen in the Lower Region; which being raiſed up on high, and claſhing with a cold Cloud catches fire, and bends it ſelf into ſome form of a Dragon. <hi>Ignis fatuus,</hi> well known in <hi>Engliſh</hi> by the Nick-Names of <hi>Jack</hi> in a <hi>Lanthorn,</hi> or <hi>Will,</hi> with a <hi>Wiſp,</hi> is alſo a <hi>Phenomenon</hi> of the Lower Region, but of a courſer nature. Which conceiving fire by the coolneſs of the night, and being toſſed to and fro by the Wind, is apt to run into ſteep Places and Precipices; and ſo proves ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fatal to Travellers, that ſuffer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be miſguided by ſuch a falſe Light. This Meteor is ſeen chiefly in Summer time, and moſt of all in hot Country's, as in <hi>Aethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pia,</hi> where they are very brief. When it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſingle, the Ancients called it <hi>Helena;</hi> and, when it appeared in two parts, they na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med them <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi> Laſtly, <hi>Ignis Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bens</hi> is a light and thin Meteor, without any heat; that ſticks ſometimes to mens cloaths or hair, and do's no hurt at all.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Cometa</hi> a <hi>Comet,</hi> or Blazing Star, is a Meteor conſiſting of great abundance of dry and viſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cous Exhalations, with ſome mixture of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours, both raiſed up to the Upper Region; where being well compacted together they take fire by their own motion, and appear to us in the ſhape of a great Star. Now there are three ſorts of Comets, <hi>viz. Crinitus</hi> hairy, <hi>Barbatus</hi> bearded, and <hi>Caudatus</hi> with a tail. The firſt happens, when the <hi>Pabulum</hi> is thick in the middle, and thin in the outward parts; which makes the Comet look with a kind of diſperſed light round about like ones hair a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the head. The Bearded Comet is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, when the outward parts reach no great way, and look ſomething like a Beard about the Star. The Comet with a Tail is that which ſpreads it ſelf a great way on one ſide or other, and appears to us like a Star with a long tail. Of this laſt ſort there have appeared ſeveral in our Time; but none of ſo prodigious a length as that which is yet ſo freſh in our Memory, I mean the great Comet that was ſeen but laſt Year.</p>
                  <p>The proper Time (if any) for the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Comets is <hi>Autumn,</hi> a Seaſon which do's moſt abound with Vapours and Exhalati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Their Duration is uncertain, for it falls out according to the <hi>Pabulum.</hi> However it is obſerved, that the longeſt continuance of a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met is ſix Months, and the ſhorteſt a Week.</p>

                  <p>But do you think, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets are Ominous?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>I confeſs it is a vulgar Opinion, grounded upon this Experience, that few Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets appear but what are followed with Wars, Peſtilence, Famine, or ſome other publick Calamity. But, whether thoſe Things be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally influenced by the Comets (which are a natural Meteor) 'tis more than can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</p>
                  <p>Now, to proceed,</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fulgur,</hi> a Lightning, is a flaſh of Fire that comes out of a Cloud. The matter of which Meteor being but thin and diſperſed is the reaſon why it catches fire but here and there, and that it vaniſhes away preſently.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fulmen,</hi> a Thunderbolt, is a fiery Meteor that breaks out of a Cloud with great Vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and daſhes in pieces whatever it falls upon. And this is properly that which the Philoſophers call <hi>Fulmen Diſcutiens.</hi> But there is another ſort of <hi>Fulmen</hi> called <hi>Terebrans,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it do's only bore a hole where it chances to fall. And laſtly, there's <hi>Fulmen Urens,</hi> which do's nothing but blaſt, and therefore we only call it a blaſting Lightning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But what have you to ſay of the Thunder, which commonly go's along with the Lightning?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>The Thunder is a Noiſe cauſed by the claſhing of the Exhalations againſt the ſides of a Cloud, or by their breaking out of it. Now
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62816:28"/>the Exhalations do either break out all at once, as when we break a Bladder full of Wind, and then we hear a great crack; or elſe at divers times, and then the noiſe is re-doubled. But, when the Exhalations do not break out of the Cloud, and remain ſhut up in it, then it is that we hear a Grumbling Noiſe.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>How comes it that ſometimes it Lightens without Thunder, and that on the contrary it ſometimes Thunders without any Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>When the Cloud makes no great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance to the Exhalations, then it Lightens without Thunder; and, when the Exhalation is not apt to catch fire, then it Thunders with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Lightning.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But how comes it to paſs that when the Thunder and Lightning go together, we ſooner ſee the Lightning than we hear the Thunder?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>By the ſame reaſon that we ſooner ſee the fire of a Cannon ſhot off at ſome diſtance, than we hear the noiſe of it. And that is, becauſe our Sight is quicker than our Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Cloud</hi> is a great heap of Vapours raiſed up by the Sun and other Stars to the middle Region of the Air, and there condenſated by the coldneſs of it. Now ſome Clouds are thin, bright, and airy, apt to be diſſipated either by the heat of the Sun, or by the force of Winds; when others are thick, black, full of moiſture, and conſequently fit for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of Rain.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>Rain</hi> is nothing elſe but a Cloud diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And, when the Vapours are but thin, then it Rains ſmall; when thick, the Rain is greater. Sometimes there has been ſeen Frogs, little Fiſhes, Bloud, Milk, Stones; Iron, and the like, come down with the Rain; but then it is, as the Philoſophers call it, <hi>Pluvia Prodigioſa,</hi> a Prodigious Rain. Of all the Winds, none is ſo apt to bring Rain as a <hi>South</hi> Wind; and of all other ſigns of Rain, a pale Moon is one of the trueſt, according to the foreſaid Verſe, <hi>Pallida Luna pluit,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:62816:29"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Snow</hi> is a Meteor of a Spungious Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, into which the Clouds do frequently diſſolve themſelves in Winter. For then, the middle Region of the Air being colder than ordinary, the Clouds are ſo affected, and (as it were) bound with the coldneſs thereof, that inſtead of Rain, they diſſolve themſelves into that white, fleece-like, and light Subſtance we call Snow. Some think the Clouds that produce this Meteor have almoſt in them as great a quantity of Exhalations as Vapours, and that thoſe being extinguiſhed in theſe, make that ſpungious ſubſtance which at laſt breaks, and comes fleeting down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hail</hi> is nothing elſe but Rain congealed in the Air; when the Rain coming down from the middle Region is ſurprized by the heat of the lower Region, and ſo congeals it ſelf into hail to reſiſt it. Whereby you may conclude, and 'tis found ſo by experience, that hot Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's are moſt of all ſubject to this kind of Meteor.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Dew</hi> is but a thin and light Vapour, raiſed not much above the Ground. Which Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pour being condenſated by a temperate cool Night, diſſolves it ſelf into ſmall drops of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and falls down here and there. But then it muſt be calm weather, or elſe thoſe light Vapours (if diſturbed by any Wind) cannot condenſate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hoar-Frost,</hi> or <hi>Rime,</hi> is nothing elſe but a Winter Dew, congealed into the form of white

                  <p>'Tis a Dew which Men gather upon ſome Trees, and the Bees upon ſome ſorts of Flowers, qualified by a Spirit which thoſe Trees and Flowers do ſometimes exhale into their Leaves.</p>
                  <p>To proceed, a <hi>Miſt,</hi> or <hi>Fog,</hi> is a Vapour that ſeldom riſes but at the Sun-riſing or Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet, and which the cold weather do's ſo conden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſate by degrees, that it lies about us and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the very Air we breath. This Meteor (which ſometimes has an unwholſome ſmell with it) is moſt common in <hi>Autumn</hi> and in <hi>Winter,</hi> when the Sun being fartheſt from us has not ſtrength to raiſe thoſe thick Vapours above us up to the middle Region.</p>

                     <hi>Parhelius</hi> is the Image of the Sun reflected upon a Cloud. And, when it happens that we ſee ſeveral Suns, it is but by the Impreſſion of one Cloud upon another diſpoſed to receive that Image.</p>

This is the moſt common of all theſe luminous Meteors, fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen either in a Morning or in an Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and that with theſe four Colours, red, green, white; and yellow.

                  <p>At laſt from the Heavens and the Air we are now come to our cloggy Element, the <hi>Earth,</hi> the Mother of Stones, Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Minerals, Plants, and living Creatures. This Earth where God has diſplayed the Wonders of his Infinite Wiſdom, Goodneſs, and Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency; but where Men ſhew daily their Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, Malice, and Weakneſs. This Earth, the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:62816:31"/>general Stage of Mankind, where are daily acted innumerable ridiculous Farces and fatal Tragedy's. Which made a merry-conceited Author cry out, not without reaſon, in theſe Words, <hi>Where ſhall a Man walk, and not meet with</hi> Seignior Deliro? that is Mr. Mad-man. This Earth in fine, which has been of old a Prey to Ambitious and Greedy Conquerors, thoſe cruel and blood-thirſty Leeches that take ſuch delight in Blood, thoſe Enemies and Diſturbers of Man-kind, whoſe boundleſs Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Avarice the World cannot ſatiate. Theſe are the Idols that will not be appeaſed without Humane Sacrifices; Theſe, the wild Boars that waſte our <hi>Arcadia</hi>'s. But where is the <hi>Hercules?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now to give you a <hi>Geographical</hi> Account of this Earth, I muſt tell you in the firſt place, that the Earth and Waters together make a round Body, commonly called <hi>Terreſtrial,</hi> but more properly <hi>Terr-Aqueous,</hi> Globe. <hi>Terr-Aqueous,</hi> becauſe it conſiſts of Earth and Waters; and Globe, from its Figure. Now this Globe is all ſurrounded with the Air, and hangs in the midſt of it.</p>

                  <p>How is it poſſible for the Earth and Waters together to make a round Body, when there are ſo many Mountains, and ſome of them of a prodigious height?</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Thoſe Mountains in reſpect to the Globe are nothing, if compared to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it. Witneſs <hi>el Pico,</hi> one of the higheſt Hills in the known World, and yet not above two
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:62816:31"/>Leagues high perpendicularly. And what is, I pray, the diſproportion of two Leagues in a Body which no leſs than 1200. only to the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or the middle point?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you ſay ſo? How big is then the <hi>Terr-Aqueous</hi> Globe about?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>It is no leſs than 360. Degrees, which at 20. Leagues (or 60. miles) a Degree comes to 7200. leagues, or 21600. miles. And yet 'tis all but a Point, if compared with Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Now the Diameter being in all round Bodies the third part of the Circumference, it follows that the Diameter of the Terreſtrial Globe is 2400. leagues, and conſequently the Semi-Diameter (which reaches but to the Center) 1200. leagues.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I am ſatisfied as to that, but I am gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velled upon another account. For I cannot conceive how ſo great and ſo heavy a Body as is the <hi>Terr-Aqueous</hi> Globe (as you call it) ſhould hang in the Air without any ſupport, when if we throw but a ſtone into the Air it preſently falls down.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>The Reaſon is, becauſe all heavy things do naturally incline to their Center, which is thought to have an attractive faculty to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The next Thing we muſt conſider is, that one part of the Earth is viſible, and the other part under Water. Now the Queſtion is, you will ſay, which of the two Superficies is greater, that of the Earth, or that of the Water. But
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:62816:32"/>this we cannot tell certainly, becauſe one great Part of the <hi>Terr-Aqueous</hi> Globe is as yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to us. And, if we ſpeak only of that Part which is known, there is no doubt, in caſe that we do reckon Lakes and Rivers, but that the Superficies of the Water exceeds that of the Land. Otherwiſe I find no great odds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Sea and the Land. 'Tis true, the Sea gets ground now and then, and incroaches upon the Land; but 'tis as true on the other ſide, that it leaves ſome places dry. Witneſs <hi>Zealand,</hi> which formerly was under the Sea, as we may gueſs by the great Bone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſhes and Anchors that have been digged up there; and now is a pleaſant, fertile, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulous Countrey. But however all this is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, if compared to the whole Superficies of the Earth and Waters.</p>
                  <p>And ſo, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> we have hitherto ſpoke of the Earth and Waters as an Aggregate Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, now we muſt treat of them ſeparately.</p>
                  <p>Firſt You muſt know the Land, as it is more or leſs incompaſſed with Water, is principal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Into</hi> Continents, Iſlands, Peninſules.</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Continent,</hi> otherwiſe called Firm Land, is a great part of Earth, but partly watered by the Sea; as <hi>France,</hi> and <hi>Germany.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An <hi>Iſland</hi> is a part of Earth invironed round about with Water; as great <hi>Britain,</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi>

                  <p>That's a great way, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> and I look upon that diſtance as the greateſt Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt it, though I know there be thoſe who are apt to believe it. But let there be a Demurr upon that Subject; and, if you will, let us now take a Survey of the chief <hi>Penin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſules.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, I begin with <hi>Africk,</hi> the largeſt and trueſt <hi>Peninſule</hi> of all, being every where ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with Seas, except where it joyns to <hi>Aſia</hi> by the narrow <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Sues.</hi> As for
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:62816:35"/>
                     <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> you may call them (if you will) <hi>Peninſules,</hi> but not ſo properly as <hi>Africk.</hi> For, though they be almoſt ſurrounded with Seas, yet there is more than an <hi>Iſthmus</hi> in the caſe; <hi>Europe</hi> being joyned to <hi>Aſia</hi> a good way by Land, and this laſt beſides to <hi>Africk</hi> by the aforeſaid <hi>Iſthmus.</hi> But the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern America</hi> make of themſelves two large and perfect <hi>Peninſules,</hi> every where incompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Seas, but where they joyn together in the middle by the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Panama.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides thoſe great <hi>Peninſules,</hi> there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of a leſs compaſs, and yet much taken notice of. As 1. <hi>Jutland</hi> in <hi>Denmark,</hi> known amongſt the Ancients by the name of <hi>Cimbri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca Cherſoneſus, Cherſoneſus</hi> being Originally a <hi>Greek</hi> Word for a <hi>Peninſule.</hi> 2. The <hi>Taurick Cherſoneſe,</hi> from the <hi>Latin Taurica Cherſoneſus,</hi> which is properly the <hi>European Tartary,</hi> lying betwixt the Black Sea and <hi>Palus Maeotis.</hi> 3. The <hi>Thracian Cherſoneſe,</hi> from the <hi>Latin Thracica Cherſoneſus,</hi> a <hi>Peninſule</hi> which runs <hi>North</hi> from the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> in <hi>Greece.</hi> 4. <hi>Morea</hi> (formerly called <hi>Peloponeſus</hi>) in the <hi>Southern</hi> parts of <hi>Greece,</hi> this <hi>Peninſule</hi> being joyned but by a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry little <hi>Iſthmus</hi> (called the <hi>Corinthian Iſthmus</hi>) to the Continent of <hi>Greece.</hi> 5. The <hi>Golden Cherſoneſe,</hi> from the <hi>Latin Aurea Cherſoneſus,</hi> a famous <hi>Peninſule</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies,</hi> where now lies the Kingdom of <hi>Malacca</hi> and the <hi>South</hi> part of that of <hi>Siam.</hi> 6. The <hi>Peninſule</hi> of <hi>Corea,</hi> in the <hi>North-Eaſt</hi> parts of <hi>China.</hi> 7. Thoſe of <hi>Acadia,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:62816:35" rendition="simple:additions"/>Florida,</hi> and <hi>Yucatan,</hi> in the <hi>Northern America;</hi> the firſt lying <hi>Southward</hi> of St. <hi>Laurence</hi>'s Gulf; the ſecond in <hi>Florida, North</hi> of the Iſland <hi>Cuba;</hi> and the third being part of <hi>Mexico,</hi> or New <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now, among the <hi>Iſtmus</hi>'s that joyn theſe <hi>Peninſules</hi> to their ſeveral Continents, there are three of ſpecial note, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Sues,</hi> the <hi>Corinthian Iſthmus,</hi> and that of <hi>Panama.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And it is obſervable, firſt, as to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thian Iſthmus,</hi> that there was a Deſign of old to cut it through (being but ſix miles in breadth) and ſo make a perfect Iſland of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rea.</hi> This was attempted (but in vain) firſt by <hi>Demetrius</hi> King of <hi>Macedon,</hi> then by <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> afterwards by <hi>Caius Caligula,</hi> and moſt of all by the Emperour <hi>Nero.</hi> Who, to hearten his Soldiers, took himſelf a Spade in hand, and began the Work. But at laſt they being fright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Blood which abundantly broke forth, with the Groans and Roarings they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually heard, and with the Hobgoblins and Furies which were always in their ſight (as if God had not been pleaſed with ſo proud an Enterprize) perſwaded the Emperour to give over this unprofitable Deſign, as had done the former Princes on the like Diſcouragements.</p>
                  <p>As to that of <hi>Panama,</hi> which is twenty Leagues in breadth (a ſmall Ligament for ſo great a Body as the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern America</hi>) there has been alſo ſome thoughts of cutting a Navigable Channel through that
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:62816:36"/>
                     <hi>Isthmus;</hi> whereby thoſe two <hi>Peninſules</hi> ſhould be turned into Iſlands, and the long Voya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges to <hi>China</hi> and the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s might be very much ſhortned. The Thing it ſelf has been of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentimes moved to the Council of <hi>Spain.</hi> But it was not thought convenient to attempt it.</p>
                  <p>In <hi>Aegypt Seſoſtris</hi> King of that Countrey attempted to cut a main Channel from the Red Sea to the River <hi>Nilus</hi> fit for Ships of great Burthen, the marks of which proud At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt are remaining ſtill. His Project was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by <hi>Darius</hi> the great <hi>Perſian</hi> Monarch, and one of the <hi>Ptolomies.</hi> But they all gave it o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver for this Reaſon, leſt by letting in the Red Sea they ſhould drown the Country, that Sea be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing found to be much higher than the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean</hi> and the Flats of <hi>Aegypt.</hi>

An Adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture not to be forgotten, and recorded by <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Writers with much Admiration. This Man, one of the Followers of Sir <hi>Francis Drake,</hi> being arrived in a ſmall Barque, with ſeventy of his Companions, a little above <hi>Nombre de Dios</hi> the chiefeſt Town of all the <hi>Iſthmus,</hi> drew his Barque on Land, covered it with Boughs, and marched over the Land with his Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, guided by Negroes, till he came to a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver. There he cut down Wood, made him a Pinnace, entred the <hi>South</hi> Sea, and went to the Iſle of <hi>Pearls,</hi> where he ſtay'd ſome days. During which he intercepted in two <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ships (who feared no Enemy on that ſide) 60000 pound weight of Gold, 200000 pound weight in Bars of Silver, and ſo returned in ſafety to the Land.</p>

                  <p>Sure enough. And therefore in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cera</hi> and St. <hi>Michael</hi> (two of the <hi>Azores</hi> Iſlands) there are now no ſuch Fires to be ſeen as there has been formerly, but only now and then a Smoak: And 'tis obſervable, that in the <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion</hi> Iſland and St. <hi>Helena</hi> the Soil is ſo like Aſhes, that it may be credibly ſuppoſed there have been formerly ſome Fires of this kind.</p>

                  <p>But do you think, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> the Hills are of as old ſtanding as the World?</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>For my part I am inclined to believe, the greateſt Hills were created at firſt as they are. Not that I think (as ſome do) that God, having firſt made the Earth perfectly Round, without any hollowneſs, or one part higher than another, and then contrived hollow pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in the Earth to contain the Waters, the Hills came of that Earth which made room for the Waters. For certainly as many more Mountains as there are in the World could not fill up all thoſe Concavities.</p>
                  <p>And yet I am apt to think, that ſome Hills have been raiſed accidentally; as thoſe Sandy Hills near the Sea in the Low Countreys, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are found many ſhells. For 'tis ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probable, thoſe Shells were carried thither with the Sand by ſome violent Winds, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards compacted together by ſucceeding Rains, and ſo hardened in proceſs of time.</p>

                  <p>I confeſs 'tis not unlikely. Now I would ſain know, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> whether or no there be Concavity's or hollow places, Windings and Turnings, Precipices, and the like, in the Bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of the Earth.</p>

                  <p>In <hi>Europe,</hi> the Foreſt of moſt note was the <hi>Hercynian</hi> Foreſt, which over-run not only a great part of <hi>Germany,</hi> but following the courſe of the <hi>Danube</hi> ſpread it ſelf over <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Tranſilvania,</hi> and from thence on the left hand over <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> A Wood ſo formidable to the <hi>Romans,</hi> that when they had gone 60. days Journey through it, they came back, and durſt not venture to ſearch the end of it. But in <hi>Germany</hi> the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part thereof is long, ſince conſumed, and no place there ſo much overſpread with it as <hi>Bohemia.</hi> In <hi>Poland</hi> and <hi>Moſcovy</hi> this Forreſt is the moſt.viſible, and in the laſt eſpecially. Which is ſo over-run with it, that, when I was there an Attendant on the Right Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable the Earl of <hi>Carliſle</hi> his Majeſties Embaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſador to the Court of <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> we travelled 15 hundred miles through that Countrey, and all within that Forreſt. Next to which for Fame was the Forreſt called <hi>Ardennes</hi> in the Lower
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:62816:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Germany.</hi> Which in the time of <hi>Caeſar</hi> extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the <hi>Rhine</hi> one way as far as <hi>Tournay</hi> in <hi>Flanders,</hi> and was in Compaſs at leaſt 500. miles. An inconſiderable Length, you will ſay, in compariſon to that of <hi>Hercynia.</hi> But now 'tis not above 30. Leagues in length reaching, but from <hi>Thionville</hi> in <hi>Luxemburg</hi> to <hi>Liege.</hi> And yet not all that Woodland neither, though within the Verge of that Forreſt; there being in that Tract of Ground many Villages, and a great deal of Arable Land.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I ſhall obſerve to you, that moſt of our <hi>European</hi> Forreſts are of Fruitleſs Tree, as <hi>Oak, Beech, Pine, Juniper, Alder,</hi> and <hi>Maple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree,</hi> of <hi>Elm, Aſh,</hi> and <hi>Poplar-tree,</hi> but above all of <hi>Firr.</hi> Though there are ſome indeed of <hi>Olive, Orange,</hi> and <hi>Myrtle-trees.</hi> But in <hi>Aſia,</hi> there are whole Forreſts of <hi>Cedar, Cinamon, Nutmeg,</hi> and <hi>Clove-trees.</hi> In <hi>Africk,</hi> of <hi>Limon, Orange, Palme,</hi> and <hi>Tamarind-trees.</hi> And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>America</hi> is famous for its <hi>Cedars,</hi> but parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly for that red and exceeding hard Wood called <hi>Braſil,</hi> from the name of a Country there which has whole Forreſts thereof.</p>
                  <p>As to Deſarts, or Wilderneſſes properly ſo called, they are either Sandy, Stony, or Moor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh. In <hi>Europe</hi> we are little troubled with them. But in <hi>Aſia</hi> there's enough of 'em, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in that part of <hi>Arabia</hi> which from hence is called <hi>Arabia Deſerta.</hi> A Countrey, (ſay's <hi>Melchior,</hi> who had travelled in it) where are ſound neither Men nor Beaſts, no, not ſo much
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62816:41"/>as Birds or Trees, Graſs or Paſture; but only Stony, High, and Craggy Mountains. In ſhort, 'tis a wild Place, and full of vaſt Deſarts, ſo waſt and deſolate, that ſuch as travel there muſt carry their Proviſions with them, and guide themſelves in their Journey by the courſe of the Stars. 'Tis true that towards <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and near the Mountains of <hi>Arabia foelix,</hi> it has ſome few Towns, reſorted to by Merchants. But this is only in thoſe Parts. <hi>North-Weſt</hi> of <hi>China</hi> there's a notable Deſart, a Sandy one, called <hi>Xamo Deſertum,</hi> the Deſart of <hi>Lop,</hi> or <hi>Xamo;</hi> through ſome part of which runs <hi>Hoang,</hi> the great River of <hi>China.</hi> As for <hi>Africk,</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts are as common there as Forreſts in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> And there is a good Part of it, lying betwixt <hi>Biledulgerid Northward</hi> and the <hi>Negroes</hi> Land <hi>Southward,</hi> that is but a continual Deſart. 'Tis that we call in <hi>Latin Lybia Deſerta,</hi> or by the name of the Country <hi>Zara,</hi> which ſignifies a Deſart or Wilderneſs. In <hi>America,</hi> 'tis ſaid there are likewiſe vaſt Deſarts, but we have as yet no good Account of them.</p>
                  <p>So, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> I ſhall conclude with theſe Reflections upon the different Nature of Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try's, as Parts of the Earth. For, whereas ſome Country's are Flat, and only ſet out with ſome pleaſant little Hills here and there; others are Mountainous, full of huge Hills and dreadful Precipices. Some are Fat and Marſhy, when others are Sand or Stony.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:62816:41"/>
                  <p>Some Country's are fruitful, irrigated with fair and Navigable Rivers, and in ſhort bleſs'd with all Neceſſaries; whilſt others are barren, unhappy, and full of Deſarts, fit only to bring forth wild and venomous Beaſts. Some pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one Thing, ſome another, according to that of <hi>Ovid,</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Nec eadem Tellus parit omnia, Vitibus illa</l>
                     <l>Convenit, haec Oleis, hîc bene Farra virent.</l>
                  </q>
                  <p>Some Country's injoy a Temperate Air, as moſt Country's of <hi>Europe;</hi> whilſt ſome are e'en Scorched by an extream Heat of the Sun, and others Frozen up almoſt all the Year round. And here it is that they have almoſt a continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Day-light for ſix Months, and as long a time of continual Darkneſs; whilſt moſt part of the World enjoys in the ſpace of 24 hours the more convenient and daily Viciſſitude of Day and Night, more or leſs. Again, ſome Country's (but Iſlands eſpecially) are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſubject to Fogs, Winds, Rain, and Change of Weather; whilſt Country's remote from the Sea do commonly enjoy a purer Air, a more Serene Sky, and ſuch Weather as is ſuitable to the Seaſon. Thoſe are commonly Unhealthful, and ſubject to divers Diſeaſes; Theſe nothing near ſo much. In fine, ſome Country's (as in the <hi>Eaſt</hi>) are much ſubject to Earth-quakes, ſome (as the <hi>Caribby</hi> Iſlands) to <hi>Hurricanes</hi> and dreadful Tempeſts, and others (as <hi>Sicily</hi> and <hi>Iſeland</hi>) to Deluges of Fire.</p>

                  <p>In our laſt Diſcourſe I have given you, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> ſuch an Account of the viſible Earth, as might fill your Expectation. Now I ſhall make it my buſineſs to be as Accurate in the Deſcription of the Waters, which (as I ſaid before) make up together with the Earth the <hi>Terr-Aqueous</hi> Globe.</p>
                  <p>In order to which I muſt tell you in the firſt place, that, as the Earth is chiefly divided into Continents, Iſlands, and Peninſules, ſo are the Waters principally divided into <hi>Seas, Lakes,</hi> and <hi>Rivers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the <hi>Sea</hi> in general is meant that great Body of Waters which is thought to incompaſs the Earth on every ſide, and is properly called by the Name of Ocean. But there are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Seas, which flow out of the Ocean through a narrow Paſſage, and ſtretch them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a long way through ſeveral Country's, therefore called Inland Seas; as the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean,</hi> the <hi>Baltick,</hi> and <hi>Red</hi>-Sea, of which more afterwards.</p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:62816:42"/>
                  <p>A <hi>Lake</hi> is a conſiderable Body of Waters, having no viſible Intercourſe with the Sea, or influx into it; as the Lake of <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A <hi>River</hi> is a Water-courſe iſſuing from ſome Spring or Lake, and continually running in its proper Channel, till it emptys it ſelf, either into the Sea immediately, or elſe into a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er River. The Place where it begins is called Spring, Head, or Source; where it runs into another, Fall, Influx, or Confluence; and where it loſes it ſelf in any Sea, that is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly termed the Mouth of the River.</p>
                  <p>But next to Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, I muſt explain unto you theſe Words.</p>

                  <p>A <hi>Gulf</hi> is properly a part of the Sea that makes a crooked or circling Shore of a large extent; as the Gulf of <hi>Bengala</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,</hi> and that of <hi>Mexico</hi> in <hi>America.</hi> A <hi>Bay</hi> is nothing elſe but a midling ſort of Gulf; Though I confeſs there are great Gulfs which bear the name of Bay, as (<hi>North</hi> of <hi>America</hi>) <hi>Baffins, Hudſons,</hi> and <hi>Buttons Bay.</hi> A <hi>Creek</hi> is a little Bay. A <hi>Streight</hi> is an Arm, or a narrow Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62816:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>of a Sea; as the Streights of <hi>Magellan, Gibraltar,</hi> and the <hi>Helleſpont.</hi> A <hi>Haven,</hi> or an <hi>Harbour,</hi> is a ſafe Place for Ships to ride at Anchor. A <hi>Pond,</hi> or <hi>Pool,</hi> is but a ſmall Body of ſtanding Waters, apt to be dryed up in <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer,</hi> if not fed with ſome Spring or other. A <hi>Torrent</hi> is a rapid Water cauſed by ſome great Rain or Thaw, and ſo ruſhing down the Hills with great ſwiftneſs. A <hi>Brook,</hi> or <hi>Rivulet,</hi> is but a little running Stream, of a ſmall extent. And by a <hi>Spring,</hi> or <hi>Fountain,</hi> is meant a little Stream immediately Springing out of the Ground.</p>
                  <p>Now, to follow the ſame Method we uſed in the Deſcription of the Earth, I muſt give you, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> a particular Account of the Seas, Lakes, Rivers, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The Ocean, which ſurrounds the World, may be divided, according to its four Quarters, into <hi>Northern, Eastern, Southern, Weſtern.</hi> The <hi>Northern Ocean</hi> is that which lies <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and the <hi>Northern America;</hi> and ſo parts them from <hi>Terra Borealis.</hi> But it is alſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Frozen Sea, as being commonly clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with Ice in Winter-time. The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> lyes between <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> called <hi>Eaſtern</hi> in reſpect to <hi>Aſia.</hi> But about the <hi>Southern Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca</hi> it is beſt known by the name of <hi>Mar del zur,</hi> or <hi>South</hi> Sea, or by the name of <hi>Pacifick.</hi> The <hi>Southern Ocean</hi> ly's <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Aſia, Africk,</hi> and <hi>America;</hi> and ſo parts them from <hi>Terra Auſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis.</hi> The <hi>Weſtern</hi> lies betwixt <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> of one ſide and <hi>America</hi> on the other ſide; cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:62816:43" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <hi>Weſtern,</hi> becauſe it ly's <hi>West</hi> of <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk.</hi> But towards <hi>America</hi> it is named <hi>Mar del North,</hi> or the <hi>North</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>Now the Ocean has ſeveral particular Names, commonly taken from the adjacent Country's. So about <hi>Brittain</hi> it is called the <hi>Brittiſh Sea;</hi> about <hi>Ireland, Iriſh Sea;</hi> about the lower <hi>Germany,</hi> the <hi>German Sea,</hi> or the <hi>German Ocean;</hi> and about <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Spaniſh Sea.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Eaſt-Indies</hi> it is named the <hi>Indian Sea.</hi> On the <hi>West</hi> ſide of <hi>Africk,</hi> from <hi>Atlas</hi> the great <hi>African</hi> Mountain, it bears the name of <hi>Atlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Sea,</hi> or <hi>Atlantick Ocean;</hi> and towards <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopia,</hi> it is from hence called <hi>Aethiopick.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides the Ocean, there are ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Seas, into which the Ocean diffuſes it ſelf. As the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which runs <hi>Eaſtward</hi> from the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> above a thouſand Leagues, betwixt <hi>Europe Northwards</hi> and <hi>Africk Southwards,</hi> as far as the Shore of <hi>Aſia.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis called the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> (that is, the Midland) Sea, from the <hi>Latin Mare Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raneum.</hi> And the <hi>Grecians</hi> upon the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count termed it in their Language <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, that is the Inland Sea. By the <hi>Spani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards</hi> it is uſually called <hi>Mar di Levante,</hi> becauſe it runs <hi>Eaſt</hi> from <hi>Spain.</hi> In the Scriptures it is called the <hi>Great Sea,</hi> as <hi>Numb.</hi> 34. where it is ſaid, <hi>You ſhall have the great Sea for a Border.</hi> And that in oppoſition to the Dead-Sea and the Sea of <hi>Galilee,</hi> lying on the other ſide of the Land of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> which are properly but Lakes of an indifferent compaſs.</p>
                  <pb n="80" facs="tcp:62816:44"/>
                  <p>But, as the <hi>Camelion</hi> is ſaid to apply it ſelf to the colour of the neareſt adjacent Body, ſo this Sea takes its denomination from the neareſt Shores. And accordingly the <hi>Romans</hi> of old gave it theſe ſeveral Names; as <hi>Mare Hiſpanicum</hi> or <hi>Ibericum, Balearicum, Gallicum, Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſticum, Tuſcum</hi> or <hi>Tyrrhenum, Liburnicum, Corſicum, Sardinium, Siculum, Auſonium, Ionium, Creticum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>The <hi>Adriatick</hi> is that which is called now a days from <hi>Venice</hi> the <hi>Gulf of Venice,</hi> a Sea (or Gulf) which runs up a great way <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt-ward,</hi> betwixt <hi>Italy</hi> of one ſide, part of <hi>Greece</hi> and <hi>Sclavonia</hi> on the other ſide.</p>
                  <p>'Tis properly but a Part (or Limb) of the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> which makes an Excurſion that way. And of this <hi>Mare Illyricum</hi> and <hi>Dalma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticum</hi> were but Parts.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Propontis,</hi> now called the <hi>Sea of Marmora,</hi> is a Sea that ly's betwixt the <hi>Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelago Southward,</hi> and the Black Sea <hi>Northward;</hi> being parted from that by the Streights called <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> or the Streights of .<hi>Gallipoly;</hi> and from this, by the <hi>Thracian Boſphorus,</hi> or the Streights of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> This Sea continues the Separation of <hi>Europe</hi> from <hi>Aſia.</hi>

                  <p>But in the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Europe,</hi> and altogether within the Bounds of it, there is alſo an Inland

                  </p>
                  <p>Betwixt <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africk</hi> is the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe called the <hi>Sea of Mecca,</hi> or the <hi>Gulf if Arabia.</hi> This begins at the Streights of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belmandel,</hi> from whence it runs <hi>Northward</hi> as far as the <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Sues,</hi> above 400 Leagues, but the breadth of it is not proportionable.

                  </p>
                  <p>Betwixt <hi>Arabia foelix</hi> and <hi>Perſia</hi> ly's an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Sea commonly called the <hi>Perſian Gulf,</hi> or the <hi>Gulf of Perſia,</hi> or elſe the <hi>Gulf of Balſora,</hi> or the <hi>Gulf of Elcatif,</hi> from two Towns of the greateſt note upon the Sea, that lying juſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the fall of <hi>Euphrates</hi> into it <hi>Northward,</hi> and this 90.

                     <pb n="83" facs="tcp:62816:45"/>This Sea is a pretty large Arm of the <hi>Southern</hi> Ocean, which breaks in at the Streights of <hi>Moſsandan,</hi> whilſt the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> falls in at the other end.

                  <p>In the <hi>Northern America</hi> you will find as large a Sea as that by the name of <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s <hi>Bay,</hi> and the way to it through <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s Streights.

                  <p>The chiefeſt Gulfs of the Ocean, I mean ſuch as do only make a circling Shore, are (in <hi>Europe</hi>) the little (but famous) Gulf in <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> called the <hi>Zuyder Zee,</hi> or <hi>South Sea,</hi> upon which <hi>Amſterdam</hi> is Seated; about <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Aquitanick Ocean,</hi> ſo called from <hi>Aquitain,</hi> of which the Province of <hi>Guienne</hi> is a part; and about <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Gulf of Cadiz.</hi> In <hi>Aſia</hi> there is the <hi>Gulf of Ormuz, South</hi> of <hi>Perſia;</hi> then the great <hi>Gulf of Bengala,</hi> in the <hi>Indies;</hi> the <hi>Gulf of Sian,</hi> further <hi>Eaſtward;</hi> the <hi>Gulf of Tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin,</hi> or <hi>Cochinchine,</hi> further towards <hi>China;</hi> that of <hi>Nanquin,</hi> in the <hi>North</hi> Parts of <hi>China;</hi> a <hi>great Gulf, North</hi> of <hi>Japon;</hi> and laſtly, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62816:46"/>
                     <hi>large Gulf,</hi> on the <hi>North</hi> of <hi>Tartary.</hi> In <hi>Africk</hi> there is a <hi>great Gulf,</hi> towards <hi>Guinea.</hi> In <hi>America</hi> you will find St. <hi>Laurences Gulf,</hi> and the <hi>Gulf of Mexico,</hi> this laſt one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt that are.</p>
                  <p>And, as the Ocean, ſo the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> has ſeveral remarkable Gulfs. As <hi>That of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencia</hi> in <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>Gulf of Lyon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and on the Coaſt of <hi>Italy</hi> the <hi>Gulfs of Genoa, Gaeta, Naples, Salerno, Policaſtro,</hi> St. <hi>Eufemia, Squil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laci or delli Caſtelli,</hi> and <hi>Taranto.</hi> On the Coaſt of <hi>Greece,</hi> the <hi>Gulfs of Larta, Lepanto, Arcadia, Coron</hi> or <hi>Calamata, Colochina</hi> or <hi>Caſtel Rampani.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the Gulf of <hi>Venice</hi> are, on the ſide of <hi>Italy,</hi> the <hi>Gulfs of Manfredonia</hi> and <hi>Trieſte;</hi> and on the other ſide Thoſe of <hi>Carnero, Naren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, Drino,</hi> and <hi>Valona.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the <hi>Archipelago,</hi> anciently ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous in <hi>Greece,</hi> are now known by the Names of <hi>Napoli, Engia, Negroponte, Ziton, Armiro, Salonichi, Aiomama</hi> or St. <hi>Anna, Monte Santo, Conteſſa,</hi> and <hi>Caridia,</hi> all upon the Coaſt of <hi>Greece.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea, beſides the great <hi>Gulfs of Bothnia</hi> and <hi>Finland</hi> in which it ends, thoſe of moſt note are the <hi>Gulfs of Lubeck, Dantzick,</hi> and <hi>Riga.</hi> And ſo I proceed to Streights.</p>
                  <p>From what has been ſaid before it doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that there are three ſorts of Streights. Some that afford a Paſſage out of one part of the Ocean into another, ſome out of the Ocean
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:62816:46"/>into an Inland Sea, and others out of one In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Sea into another.</p>

                  <p>As to Thoſe that make way from one part of the Ocean into another, there is none of note either in <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Africk;</hi> Unleſs we ſhould reckon in <hi>Europe the Channel</hi> for one, and the <hi>Iriſh Sea</hi> for another. In <hi>Aſia</hi> there are many; as the <hi>Streights of Weygatz,</hi> betwixt <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va Zemla</hi> in <hi>Terra Borealis</hi> and ſome <hi>North</hi> Parts of the <hi>Aſian Tartary;</hi> of <hi>Uriez,,</hi> near the Land of <hi>Jeſſo;</hi> of <hi>Zungar,</hi> betwixt <hi>Japon</hi> and <hi>Yupi,</hi> in <hi>Tartary;</hi> of <hi>Manille, South</hi> of a great Iſland of that name, the chief of the <hi>Philippine;</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſar, South</hi> of <hi>Celebes,</hi> another great Iſland in the <hi>Indian</hi> Sea; of <hi>Palambua, Eaſt</hi> of the great Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land called <hi>Java;</hi> of <hi>Bantam,</hi> betwixt <hi>Java</hi> and <hi>Sumatra;</hi> of <hi>Malacca,</hi> betwixt <hi>Malacca</hi> in the Golden <hi>Cherſoneſe</hi> and the Iſland <hi>Sumatra;</hi> and laſtly of <hi>Chilao,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Indian Peninſule</hi> on this ſide <hi>Ganges</hi> and the Iſland called <hi>Ceylon.</hi> In <hi>America</hi> there's the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Southern America</hi> and <hi>del Fuego.</hi> To which we may add <hi>Mare Vermejo,</hi> or the <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milion Sea,</hi> betwixt New <hi>Mexico</hi> an Iſland of <hi>California;</hi> which (though never ſo long) is properly but a Streight of this nature.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe that make way from the Ocean into Inland Seas are, in <hi>Europe, the Sund,</hi> which gives an entrance into the <hi>Baltick;</hi> and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Africk,</hi> the famous <hi>Streights of Gibraltar</hi> (otherwiſe called only the Streights)
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:62816:47"/>which is an Inlet into the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> In <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia</hi> there is the <hi>Streights of Babelmandel,</hi> which afford a Paſſage into the <hi>Red Sea;</hi> and of <hi>Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſandan,</hi> into the <hi>Perſian Gulf: North</hi> of <hi>America</hi> you will find the Streights of Davis, that lead into <hi>Baffin</hi>'s Bay; and <hi>That of Hudſon,</hi> which brings one into <hi>Hudſon</hi>'s Bay.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there are three Streights that afford a Paſſage out of one Inland Sea into another. <hi>Viz.</hi> the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> now called the <hi>Streights of Gallipoli,</hi> and by the <hi>French les Dardanelles,</hi> or <hi>le Bras</hi> S. <hi>George,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Archipelago</hi> and the <hi>Propontis</hi> or Sea of <hi>Marmora.</hi> Then the <hi>Thracian Boſphorus,</hi> or the <hi>Streights of Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> betwixt the ſaid <hi>Propontis</hi> and the <hi>Eux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine</hi> (or <hi>Black</hi>) <hi>Sea.</hi> Thirdly, <hi>Boſphorus Cimme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> now the <hi>Streights of Caffa,</hi> betwixt that Sea and <hi>Palus Maeotis.</hi>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Is not the <hi>Helleſpont</hi> that little Channel about a mile broad, over which the <hi>Perſian</hi> King <hi>Xerxes,</hi> intending to Invade all <hi>Greece,</hi> made a Bridge of Ships, and ſo waſted over his propigious Army of above two Millions of Men?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>The very ſame. But a Sudden Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt being riſen, whereby this Prodigious Bridg was dangerouſly battered, <hi>Xerxes</hi> was ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſed againſt this Sea, that he cauſed it to be beaten with 300. Stripes, and caſt a pair of Fetters into it, to make it know to whom it was Subject. Yet at laſt his Fleet was ſo bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken both by the Valour of the <hi>Greeks</hi> and the
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62816:47"/>Fury of the Sea, that he was fain to fly away over this <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> and to make uſe of a poor Fiſher-boat.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>So the proud King was fain to ſtoop at laſt, and run away with ſhame. A very fit Reward for ſo extravagant a Pride.</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Thus having taken a Survey of the Seas, Gulfs, and Streights, now we ſhall make (if you think fit) ſome Uſeful Reflections upon the Sea, and examine its Height, Depth, Colour, Taſt, and ſeveral Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Do you believe, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> the Sea is higher than the Land, or no?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>There are many that do, and who conclude it therefore a Miracle that the Land is not overflown. For my part, I do allow of a Globoſity in the Sea, but not ſuch as may indanger the Land, except where the Ground by the Sea-ſide is lower than ordinary. And in ſuch a caſe the Inhabitants truly don't rely upon Miracles, but are fain to raiſe Banks in order to prevent an Invaſion of the Sea, which never fails to incroach upon the Land when there is any way for it. But the very Courſe of the Rivers down to the Sea does manifeſtly prove the Sea to be no higher than the Land, but rather lower. In ſhort, we muſt conclude, that, if the Sea were higher than the Rivers, that would certainly come down into their Channels, and drown not only the Land, but
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62816:48"/>the Rivers. So natural it is for Water, where there is the leaſt deſcent; to move that way, one part following ſtill another without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I am very well ſatisfied as to this Point, Let us now proceed, if you pleaſe, to the Depth of the Sea.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Its Depth is very unequal. For, as the Land has Hills both great and ſmall, Valleys, and Precipices; ſo there are in the Sea, Shelves, Rocks, Whirl-pools, and Places not to be fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domed. To be ſhort, the further from Land is the Sea, the deeper it is commonly; and in ſome places it has been found no leſs than five or ſix miles deep.</p>
                  <p>As for the Colour of the Sea, it appears ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally to be of a Sky-colour. But <hi>North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> it looks darkiſh; in the Torrid Zone, <hi>Browniſh;</hi> and in ſome other Places, <hi>Whitiſh,</hi> and <hi>Yellowiſh.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>I wonder, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> you ſhould forget the <hi>Red</hi> Colour amongſt all the reſt. Or elſe how comes the <hi>Red</hi> Sea to be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>Not from the <hi>Redneſs</hi> of the Waters, nor from that of the Sands, as ſome conceiv'd; the Sea and Sands being found by latter Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to be coloured here as in other places. But you muſt know this Sea was originally called <hi>the Sea of Edom,</hi> becauſe it took begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning on the Coaſts of that Countrey. Now
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62816:48"/>
                     <hi>Edom</hi> in <hi>Hebrew</hi> ſignifies <hi>Red,</hi> as appears <hi>Gen,</hi> 25.30. A Nick-name firſt given to <hi>Eſau,</hi> and from him afterwards to Mount <hi>Seir</hi> or the Land of <hi>Edom, Gen.</hi> 36.31. and then to the Neighbouring Sea. Which by the <hi>Greeks</hi> was rendred <hi>Erythraeum,</hi> and by the <hi>Latines Rubrum.</hi> Whence the Name of the <hi>Red</hi> Sea became known to all, but the Reaſon of the Name to few.</p>
                  <p>So the <hi>White</hi> Sea in the <hi>Northern</hi> Parts of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope</hi> is probably ſo called, becauſe it waſhes the Shore of <hi>White Ruſſia</hi> or <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> For I gueſs it muſt be from hence the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> call it <hi>Bella More,</hi> and we accordingly <hi>White</hi> Sea. I am ſure by my own Experience, that it cannot be from any <hi>Whiteneſs</hi> it has. Neither has the <hi>Black</hi> Sea took that Name from its <hi>Blackneſs;</hi> but either from the great Miſts that ariſe from thence, or from the frequent Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wracks that happen there, the Shore being very dangerous by reaſon of its Rocks and Sands. How <hi>Mare Vermejo,</hi> or the <hi>Vermilion</hi> Sea, that runs betwixt the <hi>Northern America</hi> and the Iſland of <hi>California,</hi> came to be ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, I am as yet to ſeek. But, towards <hi>Cabo Verde</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> the <hi>Atlantick</hi> Ocean looks ſo green with a kind of herb, that in calm wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one would take it to be Land; and from that herb, which is ſomething like Water-creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the <hi>Portugueze</hi> call this Sea <hi>Mare di Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaſſo.</hi> In the Year, 1599. the Sea towards the Mouth of <hi>Rio de la Plata</hi> in the <hi>Southern Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica</hi>
                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:62816:49"/>appeared as red as Blood to the <hi>Hollanders</hi> that were upon that Road; but then it was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by certain red Worms wherewith the Sea was covered, and which they ſaw ſwim up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Water.</p>
                  <p>Now from the Depth and Colour of the Sea I proceed to its Saltneſs. For it is generally Salt, but chiefly in the Torrid Zone; except where great Rivers diſimbogue themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sea by ſeveral Mouth. And it is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable, that the Salter the Sea is the heavier it is, and leſs apt to be frozen.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, there are ſeveral Motions of the Sea; and firſt a general Motion from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly,</hi> the Tide, or the Flux and Reflux, when the Sea flows in for ſome hours and then go's off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. The Cauſe of which is <hi>Arcanum Naturae,</hi> a Secret of Nature, which puzzles ſtill the ableſt <hi>Philoſophers.</hi> Now the greateſt Tides are upon a Full Moon and New Moon, and likewiſe in the <hi>Spring</hi> and <hi>Fall.</hi> But in ſome Places the Flux is greater than in others, and there is ſome Seas where it is ſcarce diſcernable. The <hi>Baltick</hi> Sea has none, and the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> ſo little, that (except the Gulf of <hi>Venice</hi>) 'tis hardly to be ſeen. To be ſhort, in moſt Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where there is a Tide, the Sea flows con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly during 6 hours and 12 minutes, and then ebbs in the ſame proportion of time. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as in the <hi>Garonne,</hi> one of the chief Rivers of <hi>France,</hi> 'tis flowing water during ſeven hours, and ebbing water but five. And towards <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nega,</hi>
                     <pb n="91" facs="tcp:62816:49"/>a branch of the River <hi>Niger</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> the Tide flows but four hours, and ebbs as long again.</p>
                  <p>The Sea has alſo ſome proper Currents in ſome Places. As between the Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> and <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> the great <hi>African</hi> Iſland; where the Sea moves <hi>Southweſtward</hi> ſo ſtrongly that it is hard to overcome that Current even with a fair Wind. Whereas from <hi>Madagaſcar</hi> to the Cape a Ship may come with eaſe by the ſavour of that ſtrong Current without the help of any Wind. In the <hi>Weſt Indies</hi> there is alſo a violent Current, that is the Streights of <hi>Baha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> ſo called from an Iſland of that name to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Florida.</hi> The ſame it is with thoſe Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces where great Rivers fall into the Sea. As betwixt <hi>Loango</hi> and <hi>Congo</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> where the great River <hi>Zaire</hi> empty's it ſelf into the Ocean with ſuch a rapidity, that no Ship (as my Author ſay's) can get above half a League a day forward towards the Shore.</p>

                  <p>This is another Motion of the Sea, proper to ſome particular Places. As that of the <hi>Aegean</hi> Sea in the famous <hi>Euripus</hi> of old, betwixt <hi>Eubaea</hi> (an Iſland now known by the name of <hi>Negropont</hi>) and <hi>Achaia</hi> in <hi>Greece;</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to ebb and flow ſeven times in one day. The Reaſon of which when <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> could not find, it is ſaid (but hardly believed) that he threw himſelf into the Sea, with theſe words,
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62816:50"/>
                     <hi>Quia ego non Capio te, tu Copies me. Sicily</hi> has been alſo moſt famous for her <hi>Charybdis,</hi> a Gulf or Whirlpool, of which and <hi>Scylla</hi> oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite to it in <hi>Italy,</hi> many fabulous Things are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the ancient Poets. Wherefore <hi>Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi> the Hiſtorian calls the Fare of <hi>Meſſina, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buloſis infame Monſtris Fretum.</hi> However it is ſaid of this <hi>Charybdis,</hi> that it attracts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours all Veſſels that come too nigh it, then caſts up their Wracks at the Shore of <hi>Tauro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menium</hi> now called <hi>Taormina.</hi> And, as to <hi>Scyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la,</hi> 'tis but a Rock that ſtands dangerouſly on the ſide of <hi>Italy,</hi> with many little Rocks that ſhoot out at the foot of it. On which the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter beating very ſtrongly makes that Noiſe the Poets ſeigned to be the Barking of Dogs. Now the Paſſage between theſe two, being to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull Mariners exceeding Perillous, gave beginning to the Proverb,</p>
                  <q>Incidit in Scyllam cupiens vitare Charybdim.</q>
                  <p>Upon the Coaſt of <hi>Normandy</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and not far from <hi>Havre de Grace,</hi> there is a kind of <hi>Whirl-pool,</hi> which draws a Ship to it with great Force, but beats her off at laſt.

                  <p>The Greateſt we know of. Next to which there is another (according to <hi>Sanſons</hi> Maps) about half the bigneſs of that, called by the name <hi>Carantia,</hi> which he places almoſt
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62816:52"/>in the heart of the <hi>Aſian Tartary.</hi> In <hi>Africk</hi> you will find the grat <hi>Lakes of Zaire</hi> and <hi>Zaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan.</hi> In the <hi>Northern America,</hi> the <hi>Karegnondi,</hi> and other Lakes adjoyning to it, the length of which is not yet fully diſcovered. And. in the <hi>Southern America,</hi> the great Lake of <hi>Parime,</hi> through the <hi>South</hi> part of which runs the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quinoctial.</hi> This is at leaſt 120 Leagues in length, and 50 where broadeſt.</p>
                  <p>Our <hi>Europe</hi> alſo is ſtocked with a great many fine Lakes. As in <hi>Moſcovy</hi> the <hi>Ladoga,</hi> and the <hi>Onega;</hi> and in <hi>Sweden,</hi> the <hi>Wener.</hi> And about the bigneſs of theſe are the <hi>Beruan,</hi> in the <hi>Aſian Tartary; Chiamay,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt Indies;</hi> the <hi>Lakes of Niger, Borno,</hi> and <hi>Guarda,</hi> in <hi>Africk; Ontorio, Eric,</hi> and the Lake of <hi>Nicaragua,</hi> in the <hi>Northern America; Lago de los Xarayes, Caſſipa,</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticaca,</hi> in the <hi>Southern America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I paſs by the <hi>Lakes of Conſtance</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> of <hi>Ilmen</hi> in <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> the <hi>Dead Sea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> and a great many other of good note in all Parts of the World. Which, though they be lookt upon as great Lakes, if compared to thoſe of the leſſer ſort, yet are much inferiour to the foreſaid in bigneſs.</p>
                  <p>And, as Lakes differ in Bigneſs, ſo they do in Figure. For ſome are Round, ſome Long, and others Oval.</p>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Is their Water ſweet, or not?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>It is ſweet for the moſt part. But there are ſome indeed whoſe Water is Salt; as the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea aforeſaid, and the <hi>Dead Sea</hi> in
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:62816:52"/>
                     <hi>Paleſtine.</hi> And this muſt be either by ſome ſecret Intercourſe.they have with the Sea, or elſe by ſome Salt Springs thereby theſe Lakes are fed.</p>
                  <p>One Thing, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> is remarkable about the Lake <hi>Leman</hi> (otherwiſe called the Lake of <hi>Geneva</hi>) which is about 16 Leagues in length, and 4 broad where it is broadeſt; That, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as both Lakes and Rivers do generally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe in <hi>Summer</hi>-time, this Lake ſwells moſt in the heat of that Seaſon. And the chief rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon they give for't is the Thawing of the Snow, which comes down into it from ſeveral parts of the <hi>Alps.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But how came the Dead Sea in <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtine</hi> by that name?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis thought it came to be called Sea by reaſon of its Length and Saltneſs, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 70. miles long and 16. broad, and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing with Salt the whole Country. But it is called the <hi>Dead Sea,</hi> in <hi>Latin Mare Mortuum,</hi> either becauſe it has no viſible Efflux, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no living Creature is nouriſhed in it, by reaſon of the bituminous ſavour it ſendeth forth, from whence it has been called <hi>Aſphal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis</hi> and <hi>Aſphaltites.</hi> Near this Lake it was that ſtood once the infamous City's of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> before they were conſumed with Fire and Brimſtone.</p>
                  <p>Now you muſt know, that many Rivers ſpring from Lakes, and that Lakes are fed with Rivers. So that there is a great and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual

                  <p>In <hi>Aſia</hi> there is the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in the <hi>Turks</hi> Dominions; <hi>Indus, Ganges,</hi> and <hi>Menan,</hi> in the <hi>Eaſt-Indies; Kiang,</hi> and <hi>Hoang,</hi> in <hi>China; Gham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> according to <hi>Sanſon, Oby,</hi> and <hi>the Volga</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, in <hi>Tartary.</hi> In <hi>Africk</hi> you will find <hi>Nilus, Nubia, Niger, Zaire, Zambeze, Zambe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re</hi> and <hi>Rio de Spiritu Santo,</hi> or <hi>the Holy-Ghoſt River.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Northern America,</hi> the <hi>Canada,</hi> or St. <hi>Laurences Rives, Chucagua,</hi> and <hi>Rio del Norto</hi> or <hi>the North River.</hi> And in the <hi>Southern,</hi> the <hi>Orenoque,</hi> the <hi>Amazone, Rio de la Plata, Rio Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rana,</hi> and <hi>Rio Deſaguadero.</hi> Amongſt which the <hi>Amazone</hi> is a moſt prodigious River, and the greateſt of the Known World.</p>
                  <p>Now there is this common amongſt Rivers, I mean their Windings and Turnings, whereby the Land is moſt conveniently watred and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigated. And the great Rivers, which are on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be found in Continents, ſwell into their
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:62816:53"/>bigneſs by the continual Influx of leſſer Rivers that empty themſelves into them as they run down their Channels towards the Sea, the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Rendezvous of all Rivers. From whence it comes to paſs moſt commonly, that fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a River runs from its Spring, the larger it grows ſtill.</p>
                  <p>Again, as ſome Rivers are remarkable, for their Length and Breadth, ſo there are ſome of a notable Swiftneſs; as the <hi>Rhone,</hi> the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and <hi>Danube</hi> in <hi>Europe;</hi> the <hi>Euphrates,</hi> and <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gris</hi> in <hi>Aſia;</hi> the <hi>Zaire,</hi> in <hi>Africk;</hi> the <hi>Sague<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nay,</hi> a River of New <hi>France</hi> in the <hi>Northern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica;</hi> and the <hi>Amazone,</hi> in the <hi>Southern.</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which the <hi>Saguenay,</hi> though but a mean River, is reported to be of ſo ſtrong a Current, that it ſuffers not the Sea to flow up its Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel; ſo deep, that in many places it attains to a 100. fathoms. And, which is obſervable, the ſame is narrower at the Influx of it into the great <hi>Canada</hi> than it is at the very head. A Thing quite contrary to the general Rule.</p>
                  <p>Some Rivers run under Ground more or leſs in the midſt of their Courſe, and at laſt come up again as new Rivers. Such are the <hi>Guadiana</hi> and the <hi>Rhone</hi> in <hi>Europe, Tigris</hi> in <hi>Aſia, Niger</hi> and <hi>Nubia</hi> in <hi>Africk.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some ſpread themſelves into the form of a Lake, as the <hi>Tanais</hi> and <hi>Oby.</hi> And others croſs a Lake with ſo ſwift a courſe, that they preſerve themſelves diſtinct from the Waters of it; as the. <hi>Rhone</hi> aforeſaid, which coming down
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:62816:54"/>the <hi>Alpes</hi> falls into the Lake <hi>Leman,</hi> and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving run through the whole length of it from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt</hi> comes out at <hi>Geneva.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Some Rivers have great <hi>Cataracts</hi> or Falls, as the <hi>Rhine</hi> betwixt <hi>Bilefelt</hi> and <hi>Shaffauſen,</hi> the <hi>Rhone</hi> betwixt <hi>Geneva</hi> and <hi>Lyon,</hi> and <hi>la Somme</hi> betwixt <hi>Amiens</hi> and <hi>Abbeville.</hi> So 'tis ſaid of the River <hi>Nilus</hi> in <hi>Africk,</hi> that in two ſeveral. places it falls amongſt Rocks with ſo terrible a noiſe that the Neighbouring People grow deaf with it.</p>

And <hi>Olearius,</hi> in his Travels through <hi>Tartary</hi> to <hi>Perſia,</hi> tells us of 70. Mouths through which the River <hi>Volga</hi> (that I have been upon ſeveral times) disburdeneth it ſelf, after a winding Courſe of a thouſand leagues into the <hi>Caſpian</hi> Sea.</p>
                  <p>But there are ſome Rivers, and commonly ſmall ones, that neither fall into other Rivers, nor yet into the Sea; but either loſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the Ground, or turn into a Lake.</p>

                  <p>They are generally ſo. But yet there be ſome of a blackiſh colour, ſome whitiſh, and others reddiſh. Of this laſt ſort was the <hi>Adonis</hi> a River of <hi>Phaenicia</hi> in <hi>Syria,</hi> which
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62816:54"/>riſes out of Mount <hi>Libanus,</hi> and falls into the Sea 6. miles <hi>South</hi> of <hi>Barut.</hi> This River in Summer-time uſed to contract a kind of; Red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, occaſioned by the Winds, which then blowing moſt vehemently did thereby carry down the Stream a great quantity of <hi>minium</hi> or red Earth from the ſides of the Hills where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with the Water was diſcoloured.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>Is not this the River which was report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (as <hi>Lucian</hi> has it) to ſtream blood, when the obſequies of <hi>Adonis</hi> the Darling of <hi>Venus</hi> were yearly celebrated?</p>

                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>The very ſame. Thus a natural Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent was made uſe of to give the better co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour to the Superſtition, as if <hi>Adonis</hi>'s Wounds did bleed every year.</p>

               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis to be obſerved firſt, that all Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſubject to the Tide have a Taſt of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, eſpecially near their Fall into the Sea; and, ſo far as the Tide go's, they have a brack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh kind of Taſt. But there are other Rivers, that have a brackiſh and mineral Taſt upon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Account, that is from ſuch Minerals as they meet in their Courſe.</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>You know that Rivers are apt to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flow after a great Rain or Thaw, as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens either at the beginning or at the latter end of Winter. But I have heard of a more general and conſtant Overflowing of ſome great Rivers beyond Sea, which I much, admire at.</p>

                  <p>'Tis this overflowing upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends the Want or Plenty of thoſe Countrys. And the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> amongſt others, is as fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous for that as it is for its <hi>Crocodiles.</hi> In <hi>May,</hi> ſays <hi>Thevenot,</hi> it begins to flow, and ſo increaſes every day ſome Inches till die latter end of <hi>September,</hi> or the beginning of <hi>October.</hi> At which time it begins to fall, and is as long eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing as flowing. In the Year 1658. it increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed (according to the ſame Author who was then in the great <hi>Caire</hi>) to the height of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt 22 <hi>Pics,</hi> each <hi>Pic</hi> at 24 Inches. And then the River began to decreaſe the 23d. of <hi>September.</hi>

                  <p>What becomes in the mean time of the Inhabitants and their Cattle during this great Land-Flood? For <hi>Egypt</hi> at that time muſt needs look like a Sea.</p>

                  <p>They retire upon Hills, and there a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide till the decreaſe of the Waters, holding ſtill a Commerce by the Intercourſe of Boats.</p>
                  <p>Now, as it happens ſometimes that we have ſome Years too wet and others too dry; ſo, if <hi>Nilus</hi> overflows too much or too little, <hi>Aegypt</hi> do's ſuffer for't. Unleſs it riſe to 16 Pics, 'tis a bad Year; and when it do's riſe to 24. 'tis as bad. But, if it chance at any time not to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verflow at all, 'tis worſt of all. For then it does not only preſage a Famine in <hi>Egypt,</hi> but (as ſome will have it) prognoſticates a Change in the State. And accordingly 'tis ſaid that in
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62816:55"/>the tenth and eleventh Years of <hi>Cleopatra,</hi> a little before her Fall with her Sweet-heart <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonius,</hi> the River increaſed not at all.</p>

                  <p>This is indeed very Remarkable. But, when the Water of <hi>Nilus</hi> is withdrawn to its natural Channel, I ſuppoſe the Ground is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Slimy, having lain ſo long under Water.</p>

                  <p>Beſides the Natural Diviſion of the World into Earth and Waters, there is a National Diviſion of it, which is to be the Subject of our preſent Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>And, to make it clear to ye, you muſt know firſt, the World is divided into two Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Parts, the Known and the Unknown World. The Unknown World, or that Part of the World which is yet Unknown to us, lies about the Poles, but the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Part towards the <hi>Southern</hi> Pole. That Part which lies towards the <hi>North</hi> Pole is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in <hi>Latin Terra Borealis,</hi> or <hi>Terra Polaris Arcti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca;</hi> and the other Part that lies towards the <hi>South</hi> Pole, <hi>Terra Auſtralis,</hi> or <hi>Terra Polaris Antarctica.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Known World is uſually divided into four Parts, <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africk</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> But it is a moſt unequal Diviſion, and I think it more rational to divide it thus. <hi>Viz.</hi> the Known World, firſt into two Parts, the Old and the New World; then the Old World into three, <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Africa;</hi> and the New into two, the <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern America.</hi> For, as the Old World do's viſibly conſiſt of three
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:62816:56"/>diſtinct Peninſules, ſo is the New as clearly divided by Nature into two other Peninſules, holding proportion with the former. Thus the Known World ſhall be divided (if you will) into five Parts.</p>

                     <hi>Europe</hi> is bounded on the <hi>North</hi> with the <hi>Northern</hi> Ocean, which ſeparates it from <hi>Terra Borealis; Weſtward,</hi> with the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Ocean, which parts it from <hi>America; South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> with the Streights of <hi>Gibraltar</hi> and the <hi>Mediterranean,</hi> whereby it is divided from <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frick; Eaſtward</hi> it is parted from <hi>Aſia</hi> by all thoſe Seas and Streights that run up ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively <hi>Northward</hi> from the <hi>Mediterranean.</hi> But from <hi>Palus Maeotis</hi> upward, the Bounds are uncertain, and not yet agreed on amongſt <hi>Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers.</hi> The Ancients, I know, made the River <hi>Tanais</hi> a Boundary as far as it would go: But they were ſo little acquainted with theſe Parts, and with the Courſe of that winding River, that to follow them here were to follow a blind Guide. For my part I will not preſume to preſcribe any Bounds.

                     <hi>Aſia,</hi> the greateſt of the five Parts of the World, is a Peninſule almoſt as big again as <hi>Europe,</hi> and every way incompaſſed by the Oce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, except on the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide. <hi>Northwards</hi> the Ocean parts it, as it doth <hi>Europe,</hi> from <hi>Terra Borealis; Eaſtwards,</hi> from <hi>America;</hi> and <hi>South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,</hi> from <hi>Terra Auſtralis.</hi> Then on the <hi>Weſt</hi> 'tis bounded with the Red Sea, which parts it from <hi>Africk;</hi> Next to that, with the narrow <hi>Iſthmus</hi> of <hi>Sues,</hi> where <hi>Aſia</hi> joyns to <hi>Africk;</hi> afterwards, with the <hi>Eaſt</hi> end of the <hi>Mediter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranean;</hi> and laſtly, with thoſe Seas, and Streights, &amp;c. that part it from <hi>Europe,</hi> for which I refer you thither.</p>
                  <p>The ſame, as I hinted before, was firſt cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Aſia</hi> by the <hi>Europeans</hi> from the neareſt part to <hi>Greece</hi> called by that name. Which ſpread it ſelf from that <hi>Lydian Aſia</hi> to <hi>Aſia</hi> properly

For here ſtood the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Eden,</hi> the firſt place of his Habitation, and from hence all Nations of the World had their firſt beginning. Secondly, becauſe here flouriſhed the two firſt great Monarchies of the <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> and <hi>Perſians;</hi> the firſt ſignified by the Image with the Golden Head in <hi>Daniel,</hi> and the laſt by the Arms and Breaſt of Silver. Thirdly, becauſe it was the Scene of almoſt all the memorable Actions recorded in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. And laſtly, becauſe that here our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour Chriſt was born, wrought his Divine Miracles, and accompliſhed the great Work of our Redemption.</p>

                  <p>'Tis almoſt two hundred years ago, and the firſt Diſcoverer of it was <hi>Chriſtopher Columbus,</hi> an <hi>Italian</hi> born, of <hi>Genoa.</hi> He be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Man of great ability's, and born to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake great Matters, could not perſwade himſelf, when he conſidered the Motion of the Sun, but that there was another World to which this Glorious Planet did impart both his Light and Heat, when he went from us. This World he reſolved to ſeek after, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly in the year 1486. he opened his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to the State of <hi>Genoa.</hi> But, the buſineſs being ſlighted there, he ſent his Brother to the Court of <hi>England.</hi> Who unluckily fell in his way hither into the hands of Pirates, and was by them detained a long while. However he got his Liberty at laſt, and ſo came over to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> where his Propoſition was ſo well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that <hi>Columbus</hi> was ſent for to take mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with him. But he, not having heard a long time from his Brother, conceived the Offer of his Service to have been neglected, and had already made his Addreſs to the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi>
                     <pb n="118" facs="tcp:62816:63"/>At that time Reigned King <hi>Henry</hi> VII. here, and Queen <hi>Iſabella</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi> Where <hi>Columbus</hi> at laſt, with much ado, and after many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays, had three Ships furniſhed, not ſo much for Conqueſt as for Diſcovery.</p>

                  <p>Being furniſhed with the Ships afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, he ventured upon the main Ocean, ſteer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Courſe to the <hi>Weſtward.</hi> Two whole Months did he float upon this unknown Sea, before he could ſee any Land. Inſomuch that his Men began to Mutiny, and refuſed at laſt to go on. He promiſed them to return again, if they did not ſee Land in three days. They agreed. And, as Providence would have it, on the third day, they diſcovered the Iſland <hi>Gua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahani,</hi> in the 24th Degree of <hi>Northern</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. There having Landed, he took poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of it for the Crown of <hi>Spain, October</hi> 11. <hi>Anno</hi> 1492. and called it St. <hi>Salvador,</hi> which is S. <hi>Saviour.</hi> Afterwards he diſcovered and took poſſeſſion of <hi>Hiſpaniola,</hi> and with much treaſure and applauſe returned into <hi>Spain.</hi> Preferred for this good Service, firſt to be Admiral of theſe <hi>Indies,</hi> and afterwards to a Coat of Arms with this Motto, <hi>For Caſtille and Leon Columbus has got a New World,</hi> and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion to the Title of Duke <hi>de la Vega.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next year he returned thither, diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Iſlands of <hi>Cuba, Jamaica,</hi> and <hi>Hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paniola,</hi> and in this laſt built the Town now
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:62816:63"/>called St. <hi>Domingo.</hi> In the Year 1497. (the ſame year that <hi>Vaſquez de Gama</hi> found out the Paſſage by Sea to the <hi>East Indies,</hi> a happy Time for Diſcovery's) he went another Voyage, in which he diſcovered amongſt other Places <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria</hi> in the Firm Land. And in the year 1500. he began his fourth and laſt Voyage, which he performed without adding much to his former Diſcoveries. At laſt he died in <hi>Spain,</hi> in the year 1506; and was honourably Interred at <hi>Sevil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, though <hi>Columbus</hi> be dead, yet <hi>Columbus</hi>'s Fame ſhall live to all Poſterity's.

                  <p>I have but this more to tell you upon the Subject of this Diſcovery, that after <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericus</hi> there came ſeveral private Adventurers and Undertakers out of all parts of <hi>Europe</hi> bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering on the Ocean. Amongſt whom <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan</hi> was the firſt that compaſſed the whole World, and found the <hi>South</hi> Paſſage called from him the Streights of <hi>Magellan.</hi> Wherein he was followed by <hi>Drake</hi> and <hi>Cavendiſh</hi> of <hi>England.</hi> Thus this New World became a Prey to <hi>Europe,</hi> but to <hi>Spain</hi> eſpecially. Thus the Natives were invaded, and (till the time of <hi>Charles</hi> V.) Millions of them deſtroyed by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> Cruelty, who, to ſecure their Uſurpation, and ſatiate their Avarice, laid aſide all ſenſe of Religion and Humanity it ſelf, and ſo made Chriſtianity a Bug-bear to thoſe naked Heathens.</p>
                  <q>Auri Sacra Fames, quid non mortalia cogis Pectora?</q>
                  <p>But the Blood of theſe poor People cry's for Vengeance ſtill. And 'tis obſervable already how the Monarchy of <hi>Spain,</hi> which was ſo formidable but in the laſt Century, has been almoſt ever ſince <hi>Charles</hi> the Fifth's time in a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining

                  <p>I love to take notice of great Men. Pray, what was that <hi>Magellan</hi> who firſt Sailed round about the World?</p>

                  <p>He was a noble <hi>Portugueze,</hi> well skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Navigation. Who, upon ſome Diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents received in the Court of <hi>Emanuel</hi> King of <hi>Portugal,</hi> made offer of his Service to <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and undertook the finding out a ſhorter cut to the <hi>Molucca</hi>'s than had been diſcovered. Which he effected in the year 1520. by his Diſcovery of thoſe narrow Seas, from him called the Streights of <hi>Magel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lan,</hi> whereby he at laſt entred from the <hi>North</hi> into the <hi>South-Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, to give you a Deſcription of thoſe Streights, I ſhall tell you in the firſt place, that they are in the 53. Degree of <hi>Southern</hi> Latitude, about 100. Leagues in length, with high Hills on both ſides always covered with Snow. The Paſſage, as it is tedious and unpleaſant, ſo it is very dangerous. For here the Sea ebbs and flows with a violent ſwiftneſs, and the very firſt fall into it is extremely doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and hazardous. And then it is a Place of that Nature, that which way ſoever a man Steer his Courſe, (as I told you before, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Winds) he ſhall be ſure to have the Wind againſt him. Beſides that the Courſe of the Water, ſays <hi>John Davis,</hi> is ſo full of Turnings
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:62816:65"/>and Changings, and thoſe ſo violent, that when a Ship is entred there is no returning. To which add, that the Channel is ſo very deep (in ſome places no leſs than 300. fadoms) that there's no hope of Anchorage.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, it was a whole month, (<hi>viz.</hi> from the latter end of <hi>October</hi> to the end of <hi>Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi>) before <hi>Magellan</hi> could be clear of theſe Narrow Seas. From whence he ſailed at laſt to the <hi>Eaſt-Indies.</hi> But there he was the year following unfortunately ſlain. And, of five Ships that he ſet out with, there was but one (by a happy Omen called <hi>Victoria</hi>) that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Spain</hi> in ſafety. The Commander of that Ship was <hi>Sebaſtian del Cano,</hi> who after a very long and dangerous Voyage (wherein it was thought he had Sailed at leaſt 14000. Leagues,) had the happineſs to bring home the welcome News of his good Succeſs.</p>
                  <p>But, to return to our <hi>Americans,</hi> they are credibly ſuppoſed to deſcend from the <hi>Tartars</hi> of <hi>Aſia.</hi> For, beſides that the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> is disjoyned from <hi>Tartary</hi> but by a very ſmall Streight, ſo that there is thence into theſe Country's a very quick and ready Paſſage; 'tis certain the <hi>Americans</hi> are moſt like the <hi>Tartars</hi> of any, in the whole courſe of their Life. To which add, that the <hi>Weſt</hi> ſide of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica</hi> is far more populous than the <hi>Eaſt</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Europe</hi> or <hi>Africk;</hi> Which argues that thoſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts were firſt Inhabited, and that from hence the reſt was Peopled.</p>

                  <p>A Globe is a compendious Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation of the Earth in its round Figure, with ſeveral Circles, and an exact Situation with the Names of its ſeveral Country's, Seas, chief Lakes and Rivers, Hills, Towns or City's.</p>
                  <p>A Map is either general, or particular. By a general Map is meant a <hi>Planiſphere,</hi> or a Map of the whole Earth, deſcribing the Old and New World by themſelves, the firſt on the right hand, and the other on the left.</p>
                  <p>A particular Map is a Repreſentation of a particular Part of the World, as of <hi>Europe, Aſia,</hi> on <hi>Africa,</hi> the <hi>Northern,</hi> or <hi>Southern Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</hi> Which are but particular Maps in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of a Map of the whole World.</p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="tcp:62816:69"/>
                  <p>'Tis true there are Maps indeed more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, ſuch as give an account of a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Country, or of one Province or more of that Country.

                  <p>And ſo I come to the Circles. But firſt I begin with the <hi>Axel-tree</hi> of the World, which is a right Line imagined to paſs through the Center or midſt of the World, from one end of it to the other.

                     <hi>The Equinoctial,</hi> otherwiſe called <hi>Aequator,</hi> and by Mariners <hi>the Line,</hi> is a great Circle going round the. Globe in the very midſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the two Poles. It is called <hi>Equinoctial,</hi>
                     <pb n="129" facs="tcp:62816:69"/>becauſe when the Sun is come to this Circle, then is the <hi>Equinox,</hi> that is, the day and night are of an equal length. And it hath the name of <hi>Aequator,</hi> becauſe it divides the World into two equal Parts, the one <hi>Northwards,</hi> the other <hi>Southwards.</hi> From whence comes the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of <hi>Northern</hi> and <hi>Southern</hi> Latitude, that reaching from this Circle as far as the <hi>North</hi> Pole, and this from the ſame Circle as far as the <hi>South</hi>-Pole. Now this Circle is divided in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 360. Parts called Degrees of Longitude, as ſhewing the Length of the World. Whereof the firſt 90. Degrees run from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> then 180. Degrees by the back-ſide of the Globe from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt,</hi> and at laſt 90. Degrees more from <hi>Weſt</hi> to <hi>Eaſt,</hi> all which make up the number of 360. Degrees.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The great Meridian</hi> is a Circle that go's round the Poles, and ſo divides the World likewiſe into two equal Parts. In Globes it is made commonly of Braſs. The ſame has got the name of <hi>Meridian</hi> from the <hi>Latine Meridies,</hi> that is Noon day, becauſe when the Sun is come to that Circle then 'tis Noon in the Place where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of it is the <hi>Meridian.</hi> And it is called great <hi>Meridian,</hi> in oppoſition to thoſe leſſer <hi>Meridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> which are to be ſeen in Globes and Maps. This is the Circle wherein are ſet down the 360. Degrees of Latitude, or Breadth of the World, divided into four times 90.</p>
                  <p>Now the Queſtion is, which is the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place for the great or firſt <hi>Meridian</hi> to paſs
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:62816:70"/>through. For our Modern <hi>Geographers</hi> differ much about it, which cauſes a great Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some follow ſtill <hi>Ptolomy,</hi> who placed it in the <hi>Canary</hi> Iſlands; others have removed it more <hi>Weſtward</hi> to the <hi>Azores.</hi> Neither do theſe agree amongſt themſelves. For ſome will have it paſs through S. <hi>Michael</hi> and S. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> others through <hi>Corvo</hi> and <hi>Flores.</hi> For my part I don't admire an Innovation that cauſes ſo much Diſtraction; and, whatever they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, the Remedy to be ſure is worſe than the Diſeaſe. Therefore it were much to be wiſhed, that they would agree in this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, and unanimouſly fix their <hi>Meridian</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, without which we cannot agree as to the Longitude of Places. One ſhould think, that <hi>el Pico</hi> in <hi>Tenariffe</hi> might be a Place very fit for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Zodiack</hi> is a Circle to be ſeen in Globes, and general Maps, but not in particular ones. The ſame is a ſloping Circle, croſſing the <hi>Equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noctial</hi> in two places, and dividing it into two equal Parts. It is called <hi>Zodiack,</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <hi>Zodion,</hi> that ſignifies a living Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For it conſiſts of Twelve Signs which are (as I ſaid in a former Diſcourſe) the Twelve chief Conſtellations of all the fixed Stars, and moſt of which are repreſented to us under the name and figure of living Creatures. The Uſe of this Circle is to ſhew the natural Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sun, which in a years time runs over thoſe Twelve Signs, and therefore thoſe
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:62816:70"/>Signs are called the Houſes of the Sun. Amongſt which <hi>Aries, Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo,</hi> are <hi>Northern;</hi> and the other ſix, <hi>Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricornus, Aquarius,</hi> and <hi>Piſces, Southern.</hi>

                  <p>Suppoſing you remember what I told you formerly of the <hi>Equinoxes</hi> and <hi>Solſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> I ſhall only add, that thoſe Twelve Signs anſwer to the Twelve Months of the Year, <hi>Aries</hi> to <hi>March, Taurus</hi> to <hi>April,</hi> and ſo forth; with this difference, that when the Sun comes to <hi>Aries</hi> for exemple 'tis about the 10th of <hi>March,</hi> and then is our <hi>Vernal Equinox.</hi> From whence the Sun proceeds to <hi>Taurus</hi> and <hi>Gemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni,</hi> till it comes to <hi>Cancer,</hi> and then is our <hi>Summer-Solſtice.</hi> From <hi>Cancer</hi> it comes through <hi>Leo</hi> and <hi>Virgo</hi> to <hi>Libra,</hi> and there we have our <hi>Autumnal Equinox.</hi> From <hi>Libra</hi> it goes on through <hi>Scorpio</hi> and <hi>Sagittarius</hi> to the Sign of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and then is our <hi>Winter-Solſtice.</hi> From whence it comes up again, through <hi>Aquarius</hi> and <hi>Piſces,</hi> to <hi>Aries</hi> aforeſaid. Thus the Sun paſſes every Month from one Sign to another, and Seaſons follow one another. Thus we have the <hi>Vernal Equinox</hi> in <hi>March</hi> when the Sun is come to <hi>Aries,</hi> the <hi>Summer-Solſtice</hi> in <hi>June</hi> when the Sun is come to <hi>Cancer,</hi> the <hi>Autumnal Equinox</hi> in <hi>September</hi> when it is come to <hi>Libra,</hi> and the <hi>Winter Solſtice</hi> in <hi>December</hi> when it is come to the Sign of <hi>Capricorn.</hi> And, as the
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:62816:71"/>Twelve Signs anſwer to the Twelve Months of the Year, ſo the Degrees into which each of them is divided do anſwer pretty well to the Days of the Month. For every Sign con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains 30. Degrees, ſo that all of them together make up 360. Degrees.</p>

                  <p>Now you made it out to me as clear as the Sun. But what Circle is the <hi>Horizon?</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>'Tis an outſide Circle, not to be ſeen in Maps, but only in Globes and Spheres. And it is called <hi>Horizon,</hi> becauſe it confines our ſight, and divides both Heaven and Earth into two parts called <hi>Hemiſpheres,</hi> the one ſeen, and the other not ſeen. The Uſe of it is to ſhew the Riſing and Setting of the Stars, and the four Quarters of the World. But, as we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally conceive a <hi>Horizon,</hi> it is a moveable Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle. For we can never ſo little remove from any place, but we make a new <hi>Horizon.</hi> So that it is with <hi>Horizons</hi> as with <hi>Meridians,</hi> of both which we may fancy an infinite number, whereof the <hi>Vertical</hi> or <hi>Perpendicular</hi> point han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging over our heads is called <hi>Zenith,</hi> and that over the heads of our <hi>Antipodes Nadir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In ſhort, there are two kinds of <hi>Horizon,</hi> the one Rational or Intelligible, and the other Senſible. That reaches to the Firmament, and divides the whole World into two equal Parts, the one above and the other beneath our. Dwelling Place. Whereas the Senſible <hi>Horizon</hi> is only that part of the World which our ſight can reach in a Plain, the reſt of the World by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:62816:71"/>of the Rotundity of the Globe being out of our ſight.</p>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>They are two Circles at an equal Diſtance from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> that is 23. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and and a half; that of <hi>Cancer</hi> in the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern,</hi> and the other of <hi>Capricorn</hi> in the. <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Latitude. The ſame are called. <hi>Tropick</hi> from the <hi>Greek</hi> word <hi>Tropos,</hi> which ſignifies Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn; becauſe, when the Sun is come to either of theſe Circles, it goes no further <hi>Northward</hi> or <hi>Southward,</hi> but go's back to the <hi>Aequator<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> For (as I told you before) when the Sun comes to the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer,</hi> then, we have our <hi>Summer Solſtice;</hi> and, when it gets to that of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> then is our <hi>Winter-Solſtice.</hi> So that theſe Circles do mark the greateſt Decli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Sun, that, is its furtheſt Diſtance from the <hi>Aequator.</hi> Now they borrow, their Names of <hi>Cancer</hi> and <hi>Capricorn</hi> from the two Signs ſo called, through which the Sun paſſes when he comes to thoſe Circles.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Arctick</hi> and <hi>Antarctick,</hi> they are two leſſer Circles, each of them 66. Degrees and a half diſtant from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctick Northward,</hi> and the <hi>Antarctick Southward.</hi> And, there being but 90. Degrees from the <hi>Aequator</hi> to each <hi>Pole,</hi> it follows that theſe Circles are each of them but 23. Degrees and a half from their reſpective Poles, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Arctick</hi> from the <hi>Northern,</hi> and the <hi>Antarctick</hi> from the <hi>Southern</hi> Pole. Therefore ſome call
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62816:72"/>them otherwiſe me <hi>Polar</hi> Circles, becauſe near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt to the Poles.</p>
                  <p>Now the ſaid four leſſer Circles, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Tropicks</hi> and <hi>Polar,</hi> ſerve to divide the World into five Parts called <hi>Zones.</hi>

                  <p>Then you muſt know there is one <hi>Torrid,</hi> two <hi>Temperate,</hi> and two <hi>Frigid Zones.</hi> The <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> reaches from one <hi>Tropick Circle</hi> to another, and ſo takes up 47. Degrees of Latitude, which (at the rate of 20. leagues, or 60. miles, a Degree) comes to 940. leagues, or 2820. miles. In this <hi>Zone</hi> it is that almoſt all <hi>Africk,</hi> and the better part of the <hi>Southern America,</hi> lie; beſides a ſmall part of <hi>Aſia,</hi> and of the <hi>Northern America.</hi> And it is called <hi>Tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid,</hi> or Over-hot, becauſe of the great and conſtant Heat of it, cauſed by the Sun's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual courſe and return betwixt the two <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks</hi> where this <hi>Zone</hi> is placed. Which made the Ancients believe, that it could not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited for heat. But 'tis found ſince by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that it is not only Inhabited, but in ſome places moſt fruitful and pleaſant to live in.</p>

                  <p>There's one <hi>Northern,</hi> and the other <hi>Southern.</hi> The <hi>Northern,</hi> wherein we live, lies betwixt the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Cancer</hi> and the <hi>Arctick Circle;</hi> and the <hi>Southern,</hi> betwixt the <hi>Tropick</hi> of

                     <hi>Capricorn</hi> and the <hi>Antarctick Circle.</hi> Each of them takes up 43. Degrees of Latitude, which comes to 860. <hi>Geometrical</hi> Leagues, or 2580. miles. Both called Temperate <hi>Zones,</hi> becauſe lying (as they do) betwixt the <hi>Torrid Zone</hi> and the <hi>Frigid,</hi> they are ſo tempered with heat and cold, that neither of them is ſo hot as the <hi>Torrid,</hi> or ſo cold as the <hi>Frigid.</hi> In the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Temperate <hi>Zone</hi> lies almoſt all <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia,</hi> and the greateſt part of the <hi>Northern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica;</hi> and in the <hi>Southern,</hi> a ſmall part of <hi>Africk,</hi> and almoſt one half of the <hi>Southern A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica,</hi> beſides what has been diſcovered of <hi>Terra Auſtralis.</hi>

                  <p>Theſe are alſo one <hi>Northern,</hi> the other <hi>Southern.</hi> And they both lie in the utmoſt Parts of the World, the <hi>Northern</hi> betwixt the <hi>Arctick Circle</hi> and the <hi>Arctick Pole,</hi> and the <hi>Southern</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Antarctick Circle</hi> and the <hi>Antarctick Pole.</hi> So that each of them contains 23. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees and a half, which comes to 470. Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Leagues, or 1340. miles. And they are called <hi>Frigid,</hi> or Over-cold, becauſe being extreamly remote from the Courſe of the Sun through the <hi>Zodiack</hi> they partake but a little of its heat, and have Its beams but ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique, and without any reflection. For which Reaſon, and becauſe of their conſtant Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Winter-time for ſeveral Months; the Ancient Geographers and Hiſtorians could not imagine theſe <hi>Zones</hi> to be at all Inhabited, no
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:62816:73"/>more than the <hi>Torrid</hi> for its exceeding Heat. But it proves a Miſtake; though 'tis confeſſed, as to the <hi>Northern Frigid Zone</hi> which is, partly known to us, that it is, but thinly Peopled. In which <hi>Zone</hi> part of <hi>Norway</hi> and <hi>Lapland</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> is ſituate, ſome part of <hi>Tartary</hi> in <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Terra Borealis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much for the eight principal Circles, and the Uſe of them, Now let us take a view of thoſe inferiour Circles, which are called <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridians</hi> and <hi>Parallels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Meridians,</hi> or Circles of Longitude, are thoſe Lines which (like the great <hi>Meridian</hi>) go round the Globe from one Pole to the other. And the <hi>Parallels,</hi> or Circles of Latitude, are thoſe which croſs the Globe on both ſides of the <hi>Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You may ſuppoſe, if you pleaſe, as many of either ſort as there are Degrees. But, leſt the Names of Places and Country's ſhould be darkned with ſo many Lines, therefore in Globes and Maps theſe Circles do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly lie at ten Degrees diſtance of each other.</p>
                  <p>And, as by the <hi>Meridians</hi> you may find out the longitude of any Place in a Globe or Map; ſo by the <hi>Paralles,</hi> you may know the Latitude.</p>

                  <p>The Longitude you'll find thus, with a pair of Compaſſes. Firſt, ſet one foot of your Compaſs in the place the Longitude whereof you deſire to know, and the other in the next <hi>Meridian</hi> to it, whether it be on the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:62816:73"/>right hand or the left. From thence draw down your Compaſſes, following ſtill that <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridian</hi> till you come to the <hi>Aequator,</hi> and there mark upon what Degree of the <hi>Aequator</hi> the foot of your Compaſſes which was upon the Place do's reſt. Then ſee upon the <hi>Aequator</hi> how many Degrees that is diſtant from the firſt <hi>Meridian,</hi> and that is the true Longitude of the Place.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phil.</speaker>
                  <p>But then one muſt be ruled right or wrong by the great <hi>Meridian</hi> that's ſet down in the Globe or Map.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr.</speaker>
                  <p>If you dont like it, 'tis but adding or bating the number of Degrees which makes the difference.</p>
                  <p>The Latitude is to be taken thus. Firſt ſet one foot of your Compaſſes upon the Place of which you deſign to take the Latitude, and the other upon the next Parallel, whether a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove or beneath. Then draw your Compaſſes from that Place, following ſtill that Parallel till you come to the <hi>Meridian</hi> which is marked with the Degrees of Latitude, and mark up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on what Degree the foot of your Compaſſes which you did draw from the Place doth reſt. That you will find to be the true Latitude of the Place. And of that Latitude are all Places Parallel to that, how far ſoever they lie aſunder, <hi>Eaſt</hi> and <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From, what is ſaid 'tis to be concluded, that all Places juſt under the great <hi>Meridian</hi> have no Longitude, and thoſe under the <hi>Aequator</hi> no Latitude.</p>

                  <p>To find out how long is the longeſt Day in any Place whatſoever. For you muſt know, that the longeſt Day under the <hi>Aequa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor</hi> is equal with the night, that is 12. hours of Day and as many of Night. But the further you go from the <hi>Aequator,</hi> either <hi>Northwards</hi> or <hi>Southwards,</hi> the longeſt Day is longer by half an hour in every Clime, till they come to the length of 24 hours, that is, without
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62816:74"/>any night. Which length attained, they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe no more by hours, but by Months, till they come to the length of half a year, which is juſt under the Poles.</p>
                  <p>But this Diviſion of the Earth into Climes is not generally approved of, and that for theſe two Reaſons. Firſt, becauſe it is as eaſie to find out the Length of Days for any Place as to find out the Climates; and ſecondly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their vaſt Inequality.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if we muſt divide the <hi>Terr-aque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous</hi> Globe into Climes, the beſt way will be to divide each Latitude into nine Climes, and ſo each Clime ſhall equally conſiſt of ten De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. Thus the Situation of any Place will be preſently found out by the Degrees of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. As for Exemple, <hi>Paris, Rome,</hi> and <hi>Venice,</hi> being ſituate betwixt 40 and 50 Degrees of <hi>Northern</hi> Latitude, ſhall be counted in the fifth Climate; <hi>London</hi> and <hi>Amſterdam,</hi> betwixt 50 and 60, in the ſixth Clime.</p>

                  <p>Now, <hi>Philalethes,</hi> you muſt know there are ſeveral Ways of meaſuring the Earth. As by <hi>Miles,</hi> in moſt part of <hi>Europe;</hi> by <hi>Leagues,</hi> in <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain;</hi> and by <hi>Verſts,</hi> in <hi>Moſcovy.</hi> Neither do's any Nation make uſe every where exactly of one and the ſame Meaſure. For the Leagues in <hi>France,</hi> as the Miles in <hi>England,</hi> are in ſome places very ſhort, and in others as long again. But, according to the Geometrical Meaſure a League is to contain 3000. Paces, a <hi>German</hi> Mile 4000, and other Miles (as <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Italian</hi>) 1000. So that there go three of our Miles to a League, and four to a <hi>German</hi> Mile. Whereas they reckon four <hi>Moſcovian Verſts</hi> to
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62816:76"/>League. Thus a Degree is 20 Leagues, which comes to 60 <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, and but 15 <hi>German.</hi> And ſo the Compaſs of the Earth being 360 Degrees comes to 7200 Leagues, 21600 <hi>Engliſh</hi> or <hi>Italian</hi> Miles, 5400 <hi>German.</hi>

                  <p>But how ſhall I do, <hi>Sophronius,</hi> to find out the true Diſtance of any two Places, either in a Globe or Map?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Sophr,</speaker>
                  <p>In order to that you muſt firſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that two Places may differ three manner of ways, that is in Latitude only, in Longitude only, or in both.</p>
                  <p>If they differ only in Latitude, 'tis but taking with a pair of Compaſſes the difference of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, then ſumming up the Degrees it comes to, and multiplying the ſaid Degrees by Miles or Leagues, according to the foreſaid Geo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrical Meaſure. And, if there be any odd Minutes, allow for every Minute an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mile, or for every three Minutes a League.</p>
                  <p>But, if the two Places be in the ſame Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, and differ only in the Longitude, then take with your Compaſſes 5 or 10 Degrees of Longitude, more or leſs, according to the diſtance of the Places. Take them upon the Equinoctial, in the Longitude anſwering to the ſaid Diſtance. Then look how many times the Diſtance taken with your Compaſſes is comprehended in the ſpace that lieth betwixt the two Places, and ſo compute how many Degrees it comes to. And, if ſo be there remains any odd ſpace not fully anſwering the firſt
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62816:76"/>wideneſs of your Compaſſes, then take that odd ſpace with your Compaſſes being ſtraightned and made fit to it. That done, multiply the whole by Leagues or Miles, and you will find the Product to be the true Diſtance of the Places.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, if the two Places differ both in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude and Latitude, do but take with your Compaſſes the true Diſtance of the two Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes upon the firſt <hi>Meridian.</hi> Then look, as before, how many times the foreſaid Diſtance taken with your Compaſſes is comprehended in the ſpace that lieth betwixt the two Places, and multiply the Diſtance accordingly. Which being multiplied again by 20 for Leagues, or 60 for Miles, you will find the Product there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of to be the true Diſtance of the one Place from the other. And, if there be any odd ſpace remaining, do in this Caſe as in the former.</p>
                  <p>Thus you may take the Diſtance of any two Places in a Globe, or General Map, as alſo in the Maps of <hi>Europe, Aſia , Africk,</hi> the <hi>Northern,</hi> or <hi>Southern America.</hi> As for other particular Maps, they have Scales, whereby you may readily find out the Diſtance of any two Places there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned. And ſo I have done with this Part of Geography.</p>
                  <p>What remains is to give you a ſhort De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription</p>

                  <p>Thoſe are called <hi>Amphiſcii,</hi> that dwell in the <hi>Torrid Zone,</hi> between the two <hi>Tropicks.</hi> For their Shadows are both ways, ſometimes to the <hi>South,</hi> and ſometimes to the <hi>North.</hi>

                     <hi>Heteroſcii</hi> are thoſe that dwell in either of the two Temperate Zones. Called <hi>Heteroſcii,</hi> becauſe their Shadows reach but one way; <hi>viz.</hi> in own <hi>Zone</hi> to the <hi>North</hi> only, as in the other to the <hi>South</hi> only.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe we call <hi>Antoeci</hi> that dwell under the ſame <hi>Meridian,</hi> and are equally remote from the <hi>Aequator;</hi> but with this difference, that the one is in the <hi>Northern,</hi> and the other in the <hi>Sou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thern</hi> Latitude.

                  <p>It is, I confeſs, an unpardonable Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror in theſe Times, when the World has in a manner Through-Lights made in it. But, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the New World was found out, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62816:79" rendition="simple:additions"/>of the <hi>Antipodes</hi> was counted an incredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ridiculous Fable.
